        "date": "December 23, 2019, 8:18 PM  IST",
        "article": "Uttar Pradesh faced off the nationwide protests against CAA-NRC with an extraordinary statewide imposition of Section 144 and heavy deployment of forces. Yet, maximum violence has been reported from this state, including 18 deaths since Thursday. The police narrative is that protesters’ ranks were infiltrated by “outsiders” like Islamist fundamentalist outfit PFI. There is also a counternarrative, that UP has mishandled the whole affair, beginning with the authoritarian clampdown on peaceful dissent in the first place, which jammed “the safety valve of democracy”.Most of the deaths have been caused by “firearm injuries” but UP police continue to hold that they did not open fire at all. This would imply that protesters gunned down other protesters, an account that’s about as credible as that of the Hyderabad police when the four men accused of the gang rape-murder of a veterinary doctor were encountered in the wee hours. A Kanpur video has also surfaced, showing a policeman raising his gun amid the sound of gunshots. On the other hand, if the Kerala origin PFI has indeed spread its tentacles so pervasively into UP as to carry out coordinated attacks in Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Meerut, Bahraich, Agra, Firozabad and Gorakhpur, this exposes police as monumentally incompetent – something no less worrying than police playing judge and executioner.In the ‘best’ case scenario police fired in self-defence during attacks by protesters. If this is the case, it should just come clean. Trust follows from transparency. Where trust is crumbling, sweeping repression of mobile internet services will do the opposite of stopping “fear psychosis”, which is its professed aim. An independent inquiry into last week’s violence is needed, to clear the clouds of rumour and suspicion, put the blame where blame is due, and punish the guilty.430 days ago Pecaful protests!! where did you see this across the country. Your reliance on rumour mongers and anti socials for reporting has lost your credibility.        This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India. "

        "date": "February 28, 2020, 8:14 PM  IST",
        "article": "Alarmed by the recent riots in Delhi that have claimed the lives of at least 42 people, multiple international agencies and opinion makers have expressed concern and criticism. Both the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have condemned the violence against Muslims, while the UN human rights chief has expressed “great concern” over the discriminatory CAA and police inaction in the riots. But the big one is US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders attacking President Donald Trump for sidestepping the issue of anti-CAA unrest in India.Sanders could very well challenge Trump for the US presidency later this year. And should he go on to win that election, we could see greater US scrutiny of India’s human rights record. In that sense, it won’t be wise for New Delhi to put all its eggs in Trump’s basket. The US political system is far from a monolith, and American senators and congressmen wield tremendous independent powers. That the Democrat and Republican co-chairs of the Senate’s India Caucus issued a joint statement of concern over the riots exemplifies this point. And there are multiple ways in which India can feel the heat from the American establishment, including through CAATSA sanctions on New Delhi’s purchase of Russian arms. The US could also choose not to defend India at the UN Security Council over Kashmir, allowing the China-Pakistan axis to run away with the narrative there.Common secular, liberal values are the bedrock of the India-US relationship. It’s best not to undermine this. Overall, CAA and violence targeting Muslims have undermined India’s soft power. This has to be reversed if India is to get international support on crucial matters. To begin with government must hold rioters accountable without partisan considerations, no matter what religion they belong to, while disciplining BJP motor-mouths who make hate speeches and polarise the social atmosphere.363 days ago Times should be prosecuted for spreading misinformation about CAA and creating unrest in the country.  Are you deaf , blind and mentally deranged that you don't understand  what the PM and others are saying.

        "date": "December 27, 2019, 8:34 AM  IST",
        "article": "Amid unending turmoil over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Centre has sanctioned funds for the National Population Register exercise with the explicit promise that it is not linked to the divisive NRC. Rhetoric on NRC has been dialled down, but the relief has proved short lived with NPR sparking fresh worries. For one, the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, leave little to imagination that a Population Register could be a precursor to finalising a “National Register of Indian Citizens”.Equally alarming are the 2003 rules which allow anyone to raise objections to entries in the “Local Register of Indian Citizens” at the taluk/ sub-district level. It raises the prospect of genuine citizens in a document-poor country like India being subjected to harassment and witch hunts from neighbours, politically motivated groups, and a dysfunctional lower bureaucracy.BJP looks out on a limb with this one, as it finds it difficult to convince even its allies, let alone the opposition, that all these enumeration exercises in conjunction with CAA will do more good than harm. Akali Dal now wants Muslim refugees also included in CAA after supporting the legislation in Parliament. Similarly, Assam’s AGP supported CAA in Parliament but is now singing a different tune. Others like JD(U) and BJD, which also supported CAA, are pushing back against NRC. All these parties were mum earlier, despite CAA-NRC’s discriminatory and bureaucratic character as well as NRC’s apparent failure in Assam having been pointed out. While they should have exercised due diligence, BJP should now pay heed and listen to the protesting voices.But that isn’t happening yet going by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rebuke of the violent protests and unqualified backing for UP police. Videos of the violence implicate both sides. With police constraining the space for peaceful protests the danger of grievances manifesting as violence grows. Acts like booking 1,200 people at Aligarh Muslim University for a candlelight protest mustn’t be repeated. 21 shooting deaths in UP alone are excessive. Many states have said they will not cooperate in these enumeration exercises. A gaping trust deficit is accompanying the gathering storm and it portends misery, chaos and economic ruin. Let’s pull back from this chasm, and focus the nation’s attention instead on what the IMF has billed as the surprising magnitude of India’s slowdown. What the country needs is jobs and economic growth, not “maximum government”.427 days ago All the opposition parties, led by Congress, are creating lawlessness in the country on every proposal of the government by misleading and creating fear and confusion in the minds of the Muslim minorities. Recently, first it was Citizenship Ammendment Act(ACC) and now it is National Population Register (NPR)which is under fire mainly from the Congress. It is not understood why the Congress wants Muslims, alongwith other minorities mentioned in the Act, to be included in the CAA. They well understand if it is done India will be flooded with Bangladeshi Muslims, everyone claiming to be persecuted, and terrorists from Pakistan and Afghanistan. It may be mentioned here that there is already provision in this act for occasional genuine persecuted Muslim cases from these countries. India has also granted Indian citizenships to about 560 Muslims of these neighbouring countries recently.Now it is National Population Register(NPR). India is the only country in the world which has not defined its boundaries and population. That is why India is free for all. It is strange that NPR was first proposed by Congress itself in 2012-13, and Mr Chidambaram is on record having given statements in this regard in 2013 during UPA rule. NPR is nothing but a survey and compilation of socio-economic data for planning purpose and for the various welfare schemes of the people. Congress is only confusing and creating fear in the minds of the Muslim minorities for their narrow gains and vested interests. All their policies are centred around appeasement of Muslims.It is really unfortunate and they are pushing the country towards chaos and disaster....

        "date": "February 9, 2021, 7:19 PM  IST",
        "article": "The 2016 Assam victory was a milestone kickstarting BJP’s Northeast juggernaut. Now the five-year election cycle has come full circle. Returning to voters, BJP’s performance will be compared with the three-term Tarun Gogoi government, credited with ushering stability into the strife torn state. Amid Congress struggling to regroup and BJP’s 2016 allies AGP and BPF losing steam, the government enjoyed a smooth sailing, except during anti-NRC-CAA protests. The Assam BJP also boasts of a peculiar arrangement where the No 2 in government, Himanta Biswa Sarma, enjoys a higher media profile than chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.Unlike BJP’s “double engine”, Congress’s next-gen leaders are missing Gogoi’s reassuring hand. Gogoi had pushed the “grand alliance” that Congress is laboriously stitching together with Badruddin Ajmal’s AUDF, three Left parties and new outfit AGM. With BJP preferring UPPL as its new Bodo partner, Congress is wooing BPF. Congress-AUDF seat sharing talks must reconcile with many constituencies where both have pockets of influence. Ajmal is a double edged sword for Congress; his presence allows BJP to play up religious polarisation to its advantage. In Telangana and Bihar, Congress’s “grand” alliances had sunk, bereft of chemistry. But with BJP expanding even into Bodoland, the risky alliance gamble could be Congress’s best bet.Though BJP struggles with the CAA following the Assam NRC, it will be relieved at Congress’s half-hearted articulation of the two issues. CAA potentially offers amnesty to Bengali Hindus left out of the Assam NRC, but the ethnic rather than religious dimension of the illegal migration from Bangladesh was the original Assam flashpoint. BJP’s attempt to distinguish between Hindu and Muslim migration hasn’t impressed many. Not surprisingly, unlike in Bengal, BJP is soft pedalling CAA in Assam. Public opinion on NRC, which has left many Assamese stateless besides triggering corruption amid a desperate rush for documents, is also divided.The NFHS-5 survey has revealed a clear improvement in institutional health facilities in the state between  2015-16 and 2019-20. But one startling finding was the increase in malnutrition among under-5 children. While Assam seems to have escaped the public health brunt of Covid, the economic fallout, especially for migrant workers who are a big denomination in the state, hasn’t become a talking point yet. The elections have also prompted a big infrastructure push by the Centre. Amid farm turmoil, the rare direct BJP-Congress fight is also an opportunity for both parties to dictate the national narrative.16 days ago It is performance that accounts for retaining the power .As things stand BJP is in strong wicket not only in Assam but also in North East comprehensively.

        "article": "On a visit to Siliguri to take stock of his party’s organizational matters ahead of the West Bengal elections next year, BJP president JP Nadda said yesterday that the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had been delayed due to the pandemic, but as that situation is improving rules are now being framed for CAA. Further he said that CAA would be implemented very soon: “All of you will get the benefits of the law. We are committed to it.”The validity of CAA is of course pending before the Supreme Court, where it has been challenged on constitutional grounds, including the ‘basic structure doctrine’. By providing relief to minorities of six other religions living as illegal migrants in India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan the law shows an inherent bias against Muslims, when the more humane and non-controversial refugee policy would be to assess persecution on a case by case basis rather than by religion.Before the pandemic the law had opened a gaping trust deficit and seen intense blowback in different parts of the country, and also caused great damage on the foreign policy front, whether specifically in terms of India’s relationship with Bangladesh or generally its image abroad. What has changed since the pandemic? India’s health and economy have weakened significantly. Its economy contracted 23.9% in the June quarter while Bangladesh is set to overtake its per capita GDP and China is seeing an impressive V-shaped recovery. At this point national interest has a clear imperative, to rebuild India’s health and economy.

        "article": "The flurry of activity in BJP in preparation for assembly elections to Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam is the new normal in Indian politics. BJP’s programmatic clarity is in sharp contrast to the sedate Congress, yet to finalise a deal with CPM in Bengal or the contours of a proposed “grand” secular alliance in Assam. Meanwhile in Assam, BJP has trumped anti-incumbency in the Bodoland Territorial Council elections, dumped BPF and picked another Bodo party UPPL as its ally.BJP has a realistic chance of upsetting TMC after winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. It has sowed confusion in TMC by wooing influential netas like Suvendu Adhikari and is flagging the rising political violence as sign of TMC’s loosening grip. A resource rich BJP campaign also negates doughty chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s advantage of controlling the state administration. Despite BJP’s distant third place in Kerala, Muslim League’s growing clout in the Congress-led UDF and graft allegations rocking the CPM-led LDF government present opportunities for the party to chip away. A BJP outreach to Christian religious leaders, who have long backed UDF, is afoot.TN presents BJP its greatest challenge. With no organic growth in sight, the strategy of co-opting AIADMK hasn’t worked exactly to plan. Vetrivel Yatra – BJP’s springboard for 2021 – was torpedoed by ally AIADMK itself. After NDA’s poor 2019 TN showing, AIADMK’s seat allocation to BJP for assembly polls may not be similarly generous. Aligning with Rajinikanth’s untested political outfit is risky. Persisting with AIADMK, whose chief minister EK Palaniswami has surprised everyone by keeping both DMK and BJP at bay while overcoming the post-Jayalalithaa turbulence, could be BJP’s best bet.BJP’s nationwide thrust brushes aside apparent contradictions. Its leaders refute nationwide NRC in Bengal and promise a new “error-free” Assam NRC. They tout CAA in Bengal but skip mention in Assam. The governance record in Assam has been a mixed bag. There are achievements like the Bodo peace accord even as the latest NFHS reveals an eye-popping rise in proportion of anaemic children. BJP’s central power acts as a magnet drawing in disparate groups, allies and states while deftly skirting the governance question. With Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Telangana too witnessing BJP’s quest to fill spaces vacated by Congress and local parties, the great centripetal churn in Indian politics courtesy BJP shows no sign of slowing down.73 days ago It would be wonderful if one wheel of the victory chariot spun for better governance and faster economic growth.

        "date": "January 15, 2020, 1:19 PM  IST",
        "article": "The Kerala government challenge to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Supreme Court, making it a formal Centre-state dispute, marks a new phase in the opposition to the contentious legislation. Coupled with the possibility of more states refusing to take up works related to the National Population Register, the Centre has a real problem on its hands, and one that it walked into despite getting advance warning from the vociferous protests in north-east states.What has made Centre’s position difficult was the frequent invocation of a nationwide National Register of Citizens to follow CAA by government functionaries led by home minister Amit Shah. Though Centre has dialled back from this course, the almost simultaneous sanctioning of funds for the NPR exercise and the CAA has ended up likening it to the NRC. The course suggested in the Citizenship Rules 2003 to use NPR to create a National Register of Indian Citizens and a Local Register of Indian Citizens is creating another battleground, evident in the letter written by 106 retired civil servants cautioning against the disruptive nature of the exercise.Also read: Kerala govt moves Supreme Court challenging Citizenship Amendment ActGiven these circumstances, Centre must carry the states along if it wishes to make meaningful progress on integrating refugees and identifying illegal immigrants.

        "article": "Julio Ribeiro, iconic police officer who courageously led Punjab police during some of the worst years of the Khalistan militancy, has written to Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava demanding a fair probe in the northeast Delhi riots. According to him: “Delhi police has taken action against peaceful protesters, but deliberately failed to register cognisable offences against those who made hate speeches that triggered the riots in NE Delhi.” Delhi police should pay heed to Ribeiro, who battled the fires sparked by Bhindranwale’s hate speeches and almost paid with his life. He must not be cast aside as a political or ideological voice.Riots recur in India because of the impunity accorded to one section by the political establishment of the day. That has been the sad history of the 1984 Delhi riots, which must not be repeated. Police must clearly distinguish between peaceful anti-CAA protesters and those who actively instigate violence. The latter could fall on either side of the CAA-NRC political divide, and police must strictly follow the evidence in this regard rather than taking sides themselves.As CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “It’s my fundamental right and duty to stand up for peaceful protest in defence of constitutional rights.” This democratic right must be permitted, while those actively instigating violence must be hauled up. Questions have been raised, by Ribeiro among many others, why the role of BJP politicians such as Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma hasn’t been properly investigated, when some of their statements in the lead-up to the riots have been inflammatory. Proximity to the ruling party shouldn’t be an answer. Ribeiro reminds IPS officers of their vow to uphold the Constitution.

        "article": "The last few days have seen clashes between tribals and non-tribals in Meghalaya that have resulted in three deaths. The violence started after the Khasi Students’ Union undertook a rally against the Citizenship Amendment Act and for implementing an Inner Line Permit system. In North-East states like Meghalaya, the debate over CAA has taken on tribal versus non-tribal colours. This is an old fault line that had been buried over the decades. But it has resurfaced with CAA, whipping up anxieties and tensions.This goes to show that in a vast country like India, CAA means different things to different people. While BJP has been projecting it as a move to grant non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan Indian citizenship, in the North-East it has raised fears that tribals will lose control over their land and economy. Meanwhile, Muslims feel that the law indirectly relegates them to second-class status and in combination with the NRC, presents an existential threat.Add to this the recent Delhi riots and the apparent reluctance to book BJP motor-mouths who have been indulging in hate speech and polarising the social atmosphere. There’s no denying that CAA has engendered massive trust deficit in society. This in turn is leading to all kinds of tensions and violence. India cannot progress this way.

That’s the only way forward.361 days ago This is a clear attempt by the left and commies to silence the Pro-CAA supporters.

        "article": "This day, every year, we remember the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi – apostle of non-violence. Every political dispensation makes use of its share of Gandhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi themed the Swachh Bharat mission on Gandhi, a decade before that the UPA invoked him for MGNREGA. Yet the tensions between Gandhian ideals and application of draconian laws raise increasingly disturbing questions.Gandhi’s legacy of non-violent protest continues to echo across India, despite strong crackdowns. Gandhi opposed sedition laws all his life. Yet this British Raj era provision gets inappropriately wielded against dissenters. A more recent misuse involves the National Security Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. NSA is to be clamped only sparingly, for an unmanageably strong threat to public order. Detainees mustn’t be imprisoned longer than necessary. UAPA is India’s sword arm against terrorism. But its use against activists, most recently anti-CAA protesters, undermines its credibility.Some of the chargesheets filed against arrested activists deploy leaps of logic, and make for tendentious reading. For instance a chargesheet against Sharjeel Imam, accused of inciting anti-CAA “chakka jams” – a form of protest that’s routinely wielded by political outfits across India – cites as evidence of his radicalisation his reading of political scientist Paul R Brass, while mentioning disapprovingly Brass’s conclusion that communal violence must be understood as the work of organised groups rather than spontaneous outbreaks of passion. Two points are noteworthy here. First, reading academic works about riots doesn’t make one a rioter. Second, seeing riots as a spontaneous outbreak of passions is the more radical point of view, rather than the debunking of such a notion. Overall, such language in chargesheets suggests thought policing in the guise of investigation. It’s worth reflecting on what Gandhi would have made of such a case.Likewise, Narcotics Control Bureau claiming Rhea Chakraborty’s alleged crime is worse than murder is redolent of moral policing. If allegedly procuring ganja is so abhorrent, recall its legality between the dawn of civilisation and 1985 when NDPS Act wasn’t law yet. Exaggerating threats of Bollywood immorality or shutting down Amnesty International could cramp India’s soft power, at a time when a weak economy is widening its hard power deficit against Chinese machinations. Beyond paying tributes to Gandhi, our netas must adhere to his belief in empowering citizens. Using laws to liberate citizens, as in the recent farm reforms, is the way to go.147 days ago If you condone what Sharjreel Imam said in public about cutting off the whole of North East , and feel that acting against him was wrong, then I have no comment to offer about the sanity of your editors!...

To take on the China challenge, that India needs to be comparable in terms of military and economic strength, is a sound assessment on Bhagwat’s part. China today is India’s biggest strategic-security challenge and its ability to hector neighbouring countries stems from its meteoric economic and military growth. Moreover India, with close to 18% of the world’s population, generates only 3% of its GDP. It can certainly aspire to a ramping up of its economic strength.Bhagwat is also right in suggesting that New Delhi’s response to Beijing’s aggressive moves may have given the latter pause. India is a proud nation with a professional military, which Beijing seriously underestimated when it expected a subservient approach from New Delhi. That said, in some ways China has shown the mirror to India as well, as given limited resources New Delhi will face a tough challenge in countering a joint Sino-Pakistani alliance should Beijing choose to LoC-ise the long LAC (with the LAC standoff continuing, current indications are that Beijing is moving towards precisely this).While Bhagwat has done well to lay out an aspirational goal on national power, the key question that must be addressed is how to get there. Here, unfortunately, he has stuck to the beaten track, suggesting remedies that have been tried and failed before. His vision of swadeshi economics not only gave India its infamous “Hindu” rate of growth, it stands in contrast to China’s successful export driven model. Leave aside China, evidence shows that emerging nations that have succeeded in rapidly pushing up exports are the ones that have grown quickly.Bhagwat has rightly called for closer ties with South Asian neighbours such as Bangladesh. However, the reality is that the BJP government’s prioritisation of politically polarising policies like the CAA-NRC has hurt ties with Bangladesh, creating space for China to move in with large scale economic assistance. Despite this, Bhagwat continued on the old course of bashing those protesting against CAA. At present, the only way India can hope to bridge the enormous gulf in national power with China is through understandings, partnerships and trade alliances with liberal Western nations. But then, liberalism and openness are anathemas for RSS. It is here that the contradiction lies.122 days ago \"Hindu Rate of Growth\" this phrase shows the intellectual bankruptcy of the Left Liberals.  This rate had nothing to do with \"HINDU\" in any way, but was a direct  result of \"Nehruvian Socialist Secular Policies\" of 50s to 70s and can be rightly described as \" Nehruvian socialist rate of Growth\"....

        "date": "November 18, 2020, 9:58 PM  IST",
        "article": "Madhya Pradesh’s BJP government is tabling a bill to prosecute “love jihad”, a non-existent entity that also weighs heavily on the minds of other BJP state governments. The orchestrated thrust for such a law is surprising because central agencies haven’t detected a single love jihad case in the country. Hapless citizens must bear the cost of such unnecessary over-legislation, even now a prime underlying factor for poor governance in the country. Inclusive nationalism – or uniting the land and its people under one law, with the state not discriminating against citizens on grounds of region, religion, language, caste and sex – takes a beating here. In this regard, MP’s state sponsored discrimination directly challenges Article 15.Far from BJP’s longstanding Uniform Civil Code promise, the love jihad legislative trajectory leads to a differentiated civil code. Where the Special Marriage Act invites Indians irrespective of religion to enter into a marital relationship, the MP bill frowns upon allowing the same right to interfaith couples. The interfaith couple, and a religious priest if theirs is a personal law marriage, must inform the district magistrate 30 days before the wedding. With offences being cognisable and non-bailable, attracting a five year jail term even for collaborators, the law will all but criminalise interfaith marriage.A country aiming for a nation under one tax, one ration card, one civil and criminal code contradicts itself by herding citizens into religious ghettos, daring those who mingle with state sponsored harassment. Consenting adults having to contend with the state as gatekeeper and vetoholder in marriage, while being told in other contexts to become job creators and empowered citizens, betrays yet another contradiction. The new India is beginning to look like a really archaic India. Such laws will pose hurdles for New Delhi’s foreign policy as well. Unfavourable international attention stemming from discriminatory legislation with potential to fuel social conflict has grave reputational and soft power costs – recall CAA.The Centre can, of course, reveal its hand when the bill comes to the stage of governor giving assent or referring to the President. The easiest course for Centre would be to reform the SMA’s convoluted provisions that force harried couples to take the easier route of religious marriages. Such a modernising move can end the love jihad conversation over religious conversion and earn the gratitude of lovestruck youngsters. And if all else fails there is the Supreme Court, which must act as the conscience keeper of the Constitution.99 days ago You are highly prejudiced Mr. Editor. Religious conversion just for marriage are morally wrong. Why should the woman change her faith if she marries a Muslim? Why not other way round? Do think it over when and if you gat sober....

        "date": "October 13, 2020, 8:08 PM  IST",
        "article": "Former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur flagged the rising trend of governments “weaponising” sedition laws to silence critics while delivering the annual BG Verghese memorial lecture. Lokur bemoaned the flawed recourse to the sedition law despite safeguards in the law itself and multiple Supreme Court judgments since 1962. Their phrasing is clear: Criticism of government does not constitute sedition; there must be incitement that leads to imminent violence and public disorder.Lokur wondered why sedition cases were filed against countless journalists, Congress dissidents in Rajasthan, a Bengaluru teenager shouting a slogan, or a Karnataka school staging an anti-CAA play though their actions stirred no violence. From 47 cases in 2014 when NCRB started recording sedition, FIRs shot up to 70 in 2018 and 93 in 2019. Rightly, the retired SC judge found “amazing” a new trend of “attributing something to a speaker he or she never said”. On Kafeel Khan’s long spell of preventive detention under the National Security Act, Lokur noted: “While he spoke of national integrity, he was accused of promoting hatred; while he deprecated violence, he was accused of promoting violence.”The implications of such executive overreach go far beyond politics. Where critics are silenced, it’s not only a violation of human rights. Policing will turn unaccountable and lax, affecting the quality of governance. How the rape-murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras was handled is only the latest instance of this. Lokur also slammed the “cynics glibly suggesting” that those not guilty will be acquitted – detention is a “gut wrenching experience” and those trusting the judiciary to protect free speech and liberty get overwhelmed by the “painfully slow” justice delivery system. Governments abusing laws is a precursor to lawlessness in society. Dissent may be an irritant to some, but it’s also our best antidote to governance failures.135 days ago There is no governance in India in present circumstances. It is said Bhagwan hai is actually running the country..The basics of democracy lies with critics where action of govt comes under debate/scrutiny  at parliament ,  social media and TV debates. The squashing of question hour in parliament in the name of Covid was unprecedented while passing of important Bill's. Further our media is divided into two groups one for the govt and another against the govt. When you are watching debate for the govt TV anchor will not allow speakers from opposition to voice their opinion and vice versa is also true. The problem lies with accountability and responsibility.of pillors of governance with the people. The executives and media gets divided depending upon govt in the states in which Maharastra  executives are supporting govt and Bollowood but in UP same media is trying to expose the opposition. Even polticians also keep silent depending upon  state is ruled by   particular party. The issue raised of sedition charges or detention under National security act is actually damaging the basic core of democracy where independent voices are to be heard. This is happening because there is no time bound activities after arrest of person and they continue in jail for duration unknown. Further bureocracy is never question about delay in filing chargesheets and even if questioned then flimsy grounds are accepted for delay.  This problem is compounded with our judicial system where also there is no accountability for delivering judgement in time bound manner. Here two principle is applied depending upon the person one is no innocent should be punished even hundreds of culprit are freed and second justice delayed is justice denied.  Though there are laid down time frame for filing chargesheet by investigating agency but they are never made accountable.  The recent case of Sushant death was to be investigated by CBI as per direction of Honourable supreme court but no investigation was ordered for Mumbai pol6inaction by not registering FIR in the case. Even in the case of Disha Balyan, Mumbai Police have not registered FIR till date. In case of Harhras also where cannivance of Police and culprit  is visible, no investigation has been asked against police, Media makes it caste or religious issue and investigation direction leads no where. What needed is independence of all three pillors of democracy must be restored and all these pillors should be made accountable to public.if polticians fail to perform as per their manifesto, they must be debated. If there is  presidential debate in USA with president and opposition candidate, why can't we follow the same norms. The problem with Indian democracy  is that we have divided India on the basis of caste and religious lines. That lead to criticism which is being curbed with  act like sedition or National Security Act. In case changes are framed and judgment is pronounced in time bound manner, there will  be no debate...

        "date": "September 27, 2020, 8:35 PM  IST",
        "article": "Akali Dal’s exit from the NDA is a loss for BJP that goes beyond the limited numbers game in Parliament. Ties between the two parties date back to the Jan Sangh days, making Akali Dal perhaps BJP’s oldest ally. Though the split was precipitated by resistance in Punjab to the farm reform legislations, relations had nosedived in recent years. Choosing the farm bills to exit NDA is a weak gambit. The bills promise better prices and greater freedom to small farmers to market their produce. Akali Dal may have missed a trick by cosying up to protesters, instead of turning the food processing industries ministry under its belt into a force multiplier for reforms and agricultural prosperity.But each lost ally and the growing gap between the rhetoric and reality of “cooperative federalism” makes it harder for BJP to push its national agenda. In Maharashtra and Jharkhand, BJP failed to accommodate Shiv Sena and AJSU, ceding two states to UPA. Supportive or neutral parties like AIADMK, BJD, YSRCP and TRS may help BJP undermine opposition unity. But the Centre’s tightfisted approach on GST compensation, telling states to borrow to meet shortfalls, and CAG’s finding that Centre retained Rs 47,000 crore of GST compensation cess in 2017-19 to understate the fiscal deficit, could undermine trust between BJP and regional parties. While the finance ministry has refuted the CAG report, it’s worth noting that adverse CAG reports on the previous UPA government helped the current NDA drive it out of power.Many of its allies and friends, including JD(U), are uncomfortable with BJP’s hard-edged Hindutva: One manifestation was the CAA late last year that spawned large scale protests. Sukhbir Singh Badal has attacked Centre’s “callous insensitivity” to minority sentiments. The shift from the Vajpayee era’s emphasis on coalition dharma to the Modi era’s emphasis on single party dominance has left allies chafing. Neither have BJP’s sharp tactics in pushing through legislation in the just concluded monsoon session of Parliament – without much discussion or debate, and including the controversial passage through just a voice vote of the crucial farm bills – endeared it to other parties.BJP needs to develop a more accommodating style, reach out to political parties across the spectrum and build political capital with allies and potential allies. Else it may face increasing resistance in Parliament or in states – even when it is pursuing a productive agenda.151 days ago Not at the cost of principle.These are excellent bills.Someone has to think of the interest of the nation and not of election politics all the time.\"If nobody responds to your call,walk alone\"....

        "article": "Supreme Court’s stay on operationalisation of the three farm laws, while setting up an expert committee to hold talks with stakeholders, puts the judiciary on a road rarely traversed. Since December, SC has voiced its unhappiness with the government’s mishandling of the farm agitation at Delhi’s borders. It has expressed concern for the physical and mental health of protesters, lack of wide consultations while tabling the bills, and warned of bloodshed. SC’s noble intent on all these aspects, however, cannot detract from the constitutional scheme of separation of powers.This carves out the policy and maintenance of public order spheres to the executive and vests the interpretation of laws with the judiciary. The political and socio-economic issues driving the farm agitation and ensuring peace in Delhi are the executive’s headache. The justiciable elements in the imbroglio include competence of Parliament to legislate on agriculture, undermining of state levies on farm trade, and denying farmers right to judicial recourse for enforcement of contracts. Suspending laws passed by Parliament requires invoking legal and constitutional principles at the outset. So courts have ordinarily let laws be or allowed governments to hold them in abeyance while hearing legal challenges against them.The SC expert panel’s mandate to talk with farmers was originally a parliamentary committee’s remit, bypassing that option damaged government politically. The experts may inform SC about qualitative aspects of the new farm policy. But those are choices best left to governments with their extensive bureaucracy. Judiciary acting on policy prescriptions of experts can complicate the situation where some farmers demand repeal and others offer support. The expert committee’s report and its negotiations deciding the fate of laws or the course of agitations can send subversive signals too. Powerful interest groups demanding concessions may be emboldened to adopt similar pressure tactics to bypass government and Parliament.Proactiveness on the essentially political farm agitation is at odds with the passivity in determining constitutionality of recent anti-interfaith marriage laws, CAA, or even the archaic sedition law. In sedition the narrow guardrails erected by SC, like incitement of imminent violence, are frequently disregarded when authorities haul up citizens for dissent. Laws that smack of executive overreach, putting individual freedoms and equality in jeopardy, make themselves ready candidates for SC scrutiny. In contrast, stepping out of its judicial comfort zone to quell agitations and untangle policies, without the executive’s resources or mandate, is a needless risk.44 days ago It is unfortunate that a law passed duly authenticated by appropriate authorities  is in doldrums inviting Judiciary  for intervention and pass direction.The matter should have been soved from the talks that took  place time and again with the Government.

        "article": "Marking Bangladesh’s 50th year of liberation, India will host a contingent of 122 Bangladeshi soldiers at the upcoming Republic Day parade. The move recognises the historic collaboration between Indian forces and the Bangladeshi Mukti Bahini against the Pakistani forces and Razakars in 1971 that led to the birth of independent Bangladesh. That Bangladeshi soldiers will be marching down Rajpath sends out a signal of deep friendship and cooperation between our two countries.That said, the optics aside, India-Bangladesh relations haven’t exactly been smooth in the last few years. The BJP government’s championing of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens in Assam had the effect of vilifying Bangladeshis as infiltrators and criminals. Union home minister Amit Shah had even described such infiltrators from Bangladesh as termites while threatening to send them back. This had caused considerable outrage in Bangladesh, putting pressure on Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina. This in turn created an opening for Pakistan to rebuild its ties with Bangladesh.Meanwhile, China has been putting in extra effort to expand its footprint in Bangladesh, raising the prospect of a twin Beijing-Islamabad attack on New Delhi’s interests with Dhaka. In that context, the hosting of the Bangladeshi contingent in the Republic Day parade will help address any misgivings in Dhaka about New Delhi’s commitment to this bilateral partnership. It would also help if leaders in India refrain from raising divisive issues like CAA and NRC, and avoid using disparaging terms for Bangladeshis in future.44 days ago Don't think true Bangladeshi people want to intrude.

        "date": "December 30, 2020, 8:55 PM  IST",
        "article": "Among those worst hit by the Covid pandemic, India has overcome a trying year that put individual resilience and state capacity to extreme test. 2020 was the year of the big state, but that awesome power often manifested in the wrong areas. A slow start by governments after the first reported Covid case on January 30 was sought to be overcompensated by a national lockdown on 1.3 billion people giving just four hours notice to unprepared states, rudderless migrant workers, and most economic activities.The distressing sight of migrants walking along highways with their spare possessions, some with families too, reminded many of Partition’s horrors, another instance of New Delhi losing sight of ground realities. The Indian economy took an enormous hit in the lockdowns, needing successive rounds of unlocking without getting the requisite stimulus to cushion the blow. Despite the pandemic and attendant economic recession, states like UP, MP and Karnataka turned against interfaith relationships, religious conversions and beef eating. While citizens elect governments for material welfare and rule of law, the strong state facilitating police overreach and social strife is a contradiction in a democracy.The pandemic highlighted the importance of public health, and India was served well when it increased Covid surveillance to one million tests a day and bolstered ICU bed capacity. When this pandemic abates governments mustn’t retract their focus on public health, as the next contagion could be lurking nearby. The state has an opportunity to show its enabling side during the coming mass vaccination drive, when it will be needed the most. Similarly, economic revival too needs a state driven boost in infrastructure spending.Such action areas to safeguard lives and livelihoods highlight the importance of moving away from the politics of polarisation, which makes cooperation difficult. BJP’s singular focus on election victories without taking other parties and their state governments into confidence, or weaponising radical policies like demonetisation and CAA/ NRC, aren’t helping. In the current farmer agitation BJP has been isolated by other parties and this is emboldening farmers, who appear to have imbibed the radical-populist mood as well, to make unrealistic demands. The power of the Indian state was at its zenith this year, yet the farmers showed up its limits. It signifies that in the year ahead the mighty state must take a more consistent and consultative route to economic reforms, as well as to governance in general.57 days ago Another sick editorial full of lies and deceit! The editors keep hoping that if they continue to repeat the lies at least some people would start consider those as truth. The Modi government performed exceptionally well in dealing with the pandemic. Their timely actions saved millions of lives. That is the bottom line - jaan hai to jahaan hai! The supply chain of essentials, including food distribution, was never disrupted. The migrant worker crisis was caused by the cruel governments of Maharashtra and Delhi. India is already on an economic recovery path. Its agriculture sector grew even during the pandemic. . Your opposition to CAA exposed your hatred for Hindus being raped and slaughtered in the neighboring Islamic republics. You never seem to write any articles on how they treat their minorities but find reasons to praise them. Actually, the real good outcome of 2020 (in a somewhat sad manner) is that the illegal Shaheenbag nuisance exposed a lot of people who have been latently hating Hindus, Hinduism, India, India's heritage etc. You continue to play your double game on the farmer's agitation.

        "article": "If nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act have broken out across the nation, they are because the Centre doesn’t provide any clarification, beyond bland assurances, to the many large questions raised and anxieties stirred by the combo of CAA with a nationwide NRC that has been announced. For instance, does this mean every citizen will have to appear before a foreigner’s tribunal, and will be declared a non-citizen if they fail the joint CAA/ NRC test? What exactly is the documentation required – will it replicate the failed Assam NRC which is now being decried by all quarters, including the Assam BJP? What happens to those who fail?The questions do not end there. Has CAA been formulated because the government, having recognised the enormous problems that a nationwide NRC would entail, has built an escape clause for all denominations except Muslims? In that case, CAA fails a basic constitutional test of treating all religions equally. Moreover, if India now accepts responsibility for all minorities in neighbouring countries, where do we resettle them? Does this responsibility fall on Assam and the northeast – or if not, which other states?To make matters worse, the government appears to be meeting the nationwide protests with unduly harsh measures. Instead of the usual practice of clamping Section 144 on a limited area when there is an evident threat to peace, it has been liberally imposed on all of Uttar Pradesh, and the entire city of Bengaluru – interfering with citizens’ constitutional right to peacefully protest. One of India’s most reputed public intellectuals and acclaimed Mahatma Gandhi biographer, Ramachandra Guha, was roughly handled and detained for peacefully protesting – compounding India’s international shame. This was just days after police used strong-arm measures on Jamia Millia Islamia students.The cycle of protest and repression can be broken if the government were to revoke the NRC-CAA combo, which would be met with relief by all sections. But part of the problem may be the government wanting to be seen as “decisive”, which often leads it into actions which betray lack of forethought and adequate preparation – be it radical moves such as demonetisation or even reasonable ones such as GST. If that is the case, and in the light of the grave constitutional issues raised by CAA, then the best hope for peace to return is for the Supreme Court to step in without delay and quash the Citizenship Act amendments. 434 days ago The CAA is not controversial at all.

        "date": "September 7, 2020, 10:01 PM  IST",
        "article": "The Allahabad high court order releasing Kafeel Khan was a stinging rebuke of the Uttar Pradesh government, holding him in preventive detention under the draconian National Security Act for over six months. The court concluded that Khan’s speech at an anti-CAA protest in Aligarh made no attempt to promote hatred or destabilise law and order. Khan’s case shocks for another reason: His detention under NSA began two months after the speech, just when he secured bail in a related criminal case. There was no proximate or live cause at that time to necessitate detention.The NSA’s no-questions-asked detention scheme without trial or remand hearing provided a perfect vehicle for the state to trample upon Khan’s rights. The few safeguards under NSA, like the district magistrate issuing the detention order following a police report and a state advisory board headed by a sitting HC judge approving and periodically extending the detention, only served to condemn Khan to longer incarceration. Even the HC ruling took several months, and followed a 15-day ultimatum from the Supreme Court to dispose of Khan’s mother’s habeas corpus petition.Constitutional courts must thus be more vigilant and hear pleas against preventive detentions on top priority. Otherwise, it could lead to a situation where anyone deemed troublesome could wind up in jail. NSA applied against cow slaughter or criticism of serving governments reveals how a law ideally kept in handy reserve for invoking as last resort, when all else fails, has very tangibly misfired. When space for criticism and outrage shrinks, police and governments turn complacent, circumstances that can be conducive to violence and shocking crimes.Some days ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned young IPS officers against coming under the “Singham” influence. That holds for governments too on NSA abuse, actions that opposition parties may imitate when their turns come. NCRB data suggests an uptick: 697 NSA detainees in 2018 against 501 in 2017. This rising tide is a flagrant violation of SC guidelines safeguarding free speech against criminalisation through sedition, preventive detention and other IPC provisions. This disregard of SC injunctions by governments and police is the real contempt of court being committed today.

        "article": "Two contrasting faces of America were visible over the past week. It witnessed the first commercial space launch of people into orbit as SpaceX, a private company, sent two astronauts to the International Space Station on its Dragon capsule. This highlights that the US retains primacy in technology and entrepreneurship; in fact, for most researchers and professionals in the technology sector, it’s still the destination of choice. Interestingly, the US-Soviet Cold War played a major role in the successful American Apollo missions to the moon; now, as technology competition between the US and China hots up, it could rekindle the space race.Alongside, a less creditable side of American society is emerging as massive protests and riots erupted in more than a dozen American cities over the cold-blooded killing of an African-American man named George Floyd by a rogue white police officer. The killing has sparked indignation at widespread police brutality and institutionalised racism. Add to this the populist nationalism of President Donald Trump, which has added fuel to the fire. Populist nationalism is always an ethnic nationalism privileging a particular community seen as the ‘mainstream’ one, thus going against the grain of constitutional guarantees of equal citizenship for everyone. This gives rise to an ethnically and politically polarised situation that can be flammable.One might perceive a similar process of populist nationalism at work in India, with frequent instances of Muslim baiting as well as the discriminatory CAA-NRC combo. It’s just as well that controversial proposals for a nationwide NRC have been shelved for now; they deserve a quiet burial. It’s also noteworthy that widespread anti-CAA-NRC protests in India have been by and large peaceful and purposeful, whereas looting, destruction and fire bombings have been hallmarks of their American counterparts.Trump, however, is attempting leadership in another sphere by suggesting expanding the G7 to include India, Australia, South Korea and Russia. This is innovative on a number of fronts. It recognises that G7 is a restricted club of rich nations which cannot accomplish much by itself, it suggests America is back in the multilateral game instead of going it alone, it recognises the futility of including China in multilateral groupings as the latter is out to buck the liberal, rules based order. While such a grouping would indeed be welcome and re-emphasise American leadership, ongoing domestic turmoil puts a question mark on Washington’s championing of the liberal order.269 days ago An editorial written by Sagarika Ghose , I believe.

        "headline": "Capital aberration: Delhi police, shamed by rioters in February, instead turns the heat on political dissenters",
        "date": "August 5, 2020, 9:13 PM  IST",
        "article": "The northeast Delhi riots of February were a traumatic moment for the national capital. Delhi has lived in guilt-ridden unease with the brutality of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and an equally shameful history of delayed and denied justice to its victims. At the centre of this shameful past was a politician-police nexus that looked the other way during the riots and in bringing rioters to justice. This February’s riots have reopened old wounds. The onus is on the current police-neta establishment to ensure history doesn’t repeat.But Delhi University professor Apoorvanand’s interrogation, purportedly over support for the anti-NRC-CAA protests that long preceded the riots, spins a deceptive narrative. If a false equivalence is sought to be drawn between dissent and rioting, nothing could be more absurd and self-defeating. Dissent makes democracy meaningful and representative. CAA and NRC were riddled with enough biases and procedural dangers that a significant section of society, not least its youth and Muslim citizens, felt compelled to come out in peaceful protest. Months later, Delhi police seems to be making little distinction between criminal conspiracy and peaceful protest in that multitude of anti-CAA voices. The stringent anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with its restrictions on bail, record of lengthy incarcerations, and abysmal conviction rate at the end of much harassment, is a warning few with a mind to dissent can ignore.The riots, meanwhile, were an invitation to kill, maim, plunder and burn with politicians also contributing their mite to instigating violence. Delhi police, which barged into a Jamia library to assault unarmed students, failed miserably in quelling armed rioters. Now as it delves into an anti-NRC-CAA protests “conspiracy”, the February rioters have reason to be pleased. Police’s distraction with dissent could be their ticket to exoneration. Every rioter spared, on specious religious grounds as a reported top cop note to subordinate cops hinted, is invitation to more rioting. Police must stop chasing shadows.204 days ago CAA is not only a humanitarian law but need of the hour. Any body opposing this law, including this editor, is doing a disservice to humanity.Apporvanand is a known urban naxal, having this exalted position of DU professorship, is due to his leftist connections to facilitate the agenda of Communists..

        "article": "The recent ruckus in Parliament over the Delhi riots appears to reflect the polarised atmosphere in society. Over the last two days, opposition and treasury benches have clashed with the former demanding an immediate discussion on the riots while the latter wanting the matter to be taken up after Holi. With at least 47 dead, more than 200 injured and massive damage to property, the Delhi riots need to be thoroughly investigated and those guilty brought to book. Plus, there are allegations that the Delhi Police not only failed to perform its duty but also acted in a partisan manner. All of this while US President Donald Trump was on a state visit.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-133702 size-full\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lok-Sabha.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lok-Sabha.png 750w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lok-Sabha-300x246.png 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lok-Sabha-52x43.png 52w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\">In such circumstances, if the government wants to postpone discussion of the riots till after Holi, it must promise to place all the facts at its disposal, pertaining to the riots, on the table during the discussion. It needs to be understood that the Muslim community, in particular, feels extremely vulnerable today, not only because they suffer the most during riots but also because of the government’s CAA-NRC pitch. Their faith in the law and order machinery must be restored.Additionally, government is coming under criticism from several foreign quarters for its handling of the riots as well as enactment of the discriminatory CAA. The only way forward is to punish the riot perpetrators, prosecute hate speech and have unbiased investigations.

        "date": "February 26, 2020, 8:06 PM  IST",
        "article": "The unanimous Bihar legislative assembly resolution opposing the National Register of Citizens sends a strong and appropriate signal that BJP is backing away from the potentially disastrous exercise – whose Assam chapter has been denounced as a fiasco all round. Speculations of a nationwide NRC, fuelled by its presence in BJP’s 2019 manifesto and home minister Amit Shah’s electoral rhetoric, have triggered widespread disquiet. The resolution effectively sends the quixotic idea into cold storage.On National Population Register (NPR) as well, BJP appears to be relenting by allowing the exclusion of three problematic questions related to date and place of birth of parents and place of last residence that didn’t feature in the last NPR. This is a pragmatic position taken in self-interest, that could even force opposition ruled states that see NPR as a precursor to NRC to also climb down. Communicating loud and clear that no NRC is in the works is important in light of attacks on government surveyors. Failure to allay minority fears will also hurt NPR and Census enumeration activities.Just as it has diluted its position on NRC and NPR, BJP can also tweak CAA to make it more inclusive. Ascertaining persecution on a case by case basis can override deleterious CAA provisions that single out illegal migrants from some religions but not others – thus accommodating the genuine cases of Pakistani religious persecution that BJP has been highlighting, while being fair to all parties and not whipping up Muslim insecurities as well as constitutional questions of equal treatment of all religions. It is compromises of this sort that India’s divided polity – whose latest manifestation is devastating riots in the national capital even as President Trump came calling and India laid out the welcome mat – desperately needs. The Bihar BJP approach of striking common ground with partner JD(U) and rival RJD is a lesson for the Centre – which has pushed extreme and impractical measures like NRC and demonetisation without adequate consultation.Such pragmatism is in BJP’s self-interest as well, as the party cannot rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s oratorical skills alone to tide over policy fiascos. At some point BJP will have to build bridges with its opponents. As the Supreme Court observed on Wednesday, it is “time for all parties to lower temperatures”. BJP as the ruling party must move away from hardline positions and explore a détente, as it just did in Bihar. 365 days ago This should not be termed real pragmatism as it emanates from vote politics compulsion and endorsement by BJP because of same need. NPR is in a national interest which no one can dispute. Media should also voice its concern instead of playing to tune to foreign powers weakening India....

        "date": "February 18, 2020, 8:05 PM  IST",
        "article": "In what can only complicate matters in Assam if it comes to pass, a home ministry appointed committee – set up to suggest ways to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord – is learnt to have recommended the introduction of Inner Line Permit (ILP) for the state to control the influx of outsiders. ILP for Assam would mean even Indians from other states would need a permit to visit there. This would be extremely detrimental for investment and business in Assam. It could also put paid to hopes of actualising India’s Act East policy. After all, Assam and other Northeast states were supposed to serve as a land bridge between India and Southeast Asia. But identity politics is severely undermining those goals.If one wonders what led the home ministry committee to propose a self-goal such as this one, it arises out of the need to assuage Assamese opinion after the disquiet stemming from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The latter is seen by Assamese – particularly those in the Brahmaputra Valley – as violative of the 1985 Assam Accord as it seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh entering uptil December 31, 2014. The intensity of anti-CAA protests in Assam appears to have caught the Centre unawares – leading it to propose the ILP. Never mind that it opens up another, perhaps bigger can of worms.The NDA government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution to fully integrate Jammu & Kashmir with the rest of India. Curiously, it is following the opposite track in Assam and the Northeast, where more ILP zones will end up ghettoising the region. The Northeast cannot develop this way. Moreover ILP in Assam will likely see similar parochial demands across the country. This is a slippery slope we must avoid at all costs. Whatever happened to the ‘one nation’ logic that NDA was supposed to champion?373 days ago Modi giveth, Modi taketh away. Liberals taketh, liberals giveth away. Politics rules here not morals.

        "date": "February 18, 2020, 8:06 PM  IST",
        "article": "Assembly elections are still another eight months away but Bihar’s politicians are hitting the ground running. In the 2019 polls, NDA comprising JD(U), BJP and LJP had won 39 of the state’s 40 Lok Sabha seats and led in nearly 90% of the 243 assembly segments. But, as Delhi elections have shown, assembly elections are an altogether different kettle of fish. The opposition has taken note of BJP’s reversals in recent state elections. CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar was first off the block with his ongoing statewide Jan Gan Man Yatra, Tejashwi Yadav is embarking on a Berozgari Hatao Yatra, and now poll strategist Prashant Kishor has signalled his political ambitions with a 100-day Baat Bihar Ki campaign.Kishor was until recently Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s deputy in JD(U) but has no political base or conventional party apparatus to rely on. Yet his poll consultancy firm I-PAC’s success in helping strategise a number of successful election campaigns makes his Bihar splash interesting. Starting from the 2012 Gujarat and 2014 BJP Lok Sabha victories, he is today the strategist of choice for the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, Jagan Reddy, Mamata Banerjee and MK Stalin. On Tuesday, Kishor said he would demand answers from Nitish for why Bihar remains India’s poorest state despite his 15 years at the helm.Foregrounding development is sound strategy given how RJD’s gambit of building a phalanx of caste-based parties against NDA flopped in 2019. Tejashwi’s bets are on unemployment but close identification with his father Lalu’s disastrous 15-year-tenure won’t help the flailing RJD cause. Kanhaiya’s anti-CAA rallies are well attended but crowd mobilisation hasn’t translated into votes outside Left strongholds for decades now.Yet Bihar need not follow the trend in recent state elections. As early as last October, Amit Shah proclaimed that Nitish would lead the Bihar NDA, sending a strong signal to BJP leaders sniping at Nitish to pipe down. If the alliance with the “secular” Nitish-Ram Vilas Paswan duo holds, the hypernationalist rhetoric and polarising slogans that distinguished BJP’s far right lurch in recent months may be shelved. But to ensure a campaign on their terms, Nitish and BJP’s Sushil Modi will have to strongly project NDA’s achievements. The duo’s “sushasan” halo has dimmed since returning to power in 2017.373 days ago Susashan Babu's image has already shaken off due to shelter home scam and not only stagnant but worsened social and economic scenario on account of BJP.'s divisive policy and ever worst economic situation that has been pushing common man to wall..And Bihar being most poor state ,its common man suffers worst. Since last six years Nitish has changed his colors faster than even chameleon.People remember his PLEDGE , not joining  BJP, opposing Narendra Mosi when he was declared prime ministerial candidate by BJP. Since then he has changed his sides several times from having association with RJD,then deserting it, and now changing his stand on CAA.NRC.NPR; some times 'yes', some  times 'NO'. !!!!. Perhaps , had he been with Mahagathbandhan,,SAFFRON gang would not have gathered too much momentum to impose autocratic decisions on the people. Hence, he being responsible for sabotaged MAHAGATHBANDHAN,could not be taken for granted as ' TRUSTWORTHY' by the  Bihar voters.Now it is responsibility of opposition including PK, Kanhaiya Kumar,Tejasvi, humiliated Pavan Kumar Varma  and Shakti sinh Gohil of Congress to expose this  wholesome  image of Nitish , with aim of not defeating him only but to combat advancement of SAFFRONIZATION of  the secular democratic state of India.    ....

Tensions have been brewing since December when the CAA was enacted in Parliament and the election campaign in Delhi was hotting up.Even as the peaceful Shaheen Bagh protests continue, violence has erupted at Daryaganj, Seelampur, Jafrabad and on the JNU campus. The widespread perception that the police act in a partisan manner have also not helped. The North-East Delhi violence is particularly galling coming at a time when the Capital was gearing up to welcome the US president and his delegation. The intelligence failure needs fixing of culpability. The Union home ministry which supervises the Delhi Police must crack the whip. Commissioner of Police Amulya Patnaik, who recently was awarded an undeserved extension, must go. Delhi’s political parties have a role to play in restoring peace. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has expressed helplessness but there are several things he can do like visiting the affected communities, forming peace committees and probing policing failures. With anti-CAA-NRC protests raging across India, it also serves a warning to the Centre on the utility of persevering with a patently discriminatory law.367 days ago Peaceful protest at Shaheen Bagh ?

        "date": "February 16, 2020, 8:16 PM  IST",
        "article": "As the chief guest of the 10th convocation of the Gujarat National Law University on Saturday, Justice DY Chandrachud of the Supreme Court had notable advice for the students: “It is important to stand up and be dissenters. It is only through your power of expressing views and courage of stating contrary positions that you will make others stop and think.” Coming at a time when student protests, such as those against CAA-NRC, have been labelled anti-national, Justice Chandrachud’s comments on Saturday both at the above event and at the Gujarat HC auditorium were a timely, lucid and powerful reminder of how the right to dissent is at the very heart of a dialogue-based democratic society.Over the weekend disturbing video footage has also come to light, where police can be seen entering Jamia Millia Islamia’s library and lathicharging students who were just studying there. This is blatant abuse of state machinery to instil fear. And as Justice Chandrachud says, creating a chilling atmosphere for free speech really distracts from the constitutional vision of a free and pluralist society. Political detentions under PSA in Kashmir, sweeping use of Section 144 across Uttar Pradesh, repeated internet shutdowns in several parts of the country, broad spectrum use of the colonial sedition law … all these draconian attempts to quell peaceful protests are fundamentally at odds with the fact that “homogeneity is not the defining feature of Indianness.”Plurality of opinion is furthermore the basis of all growth – political, economic, cultural and social. Only asking questions and challenging the status quo lead to change and progress. So respect for diversity and freedom of expression is not only the essence of Indian democracy, it is also the guarantor of a better future.375 days ago The CJI  of India Mr. Bobde  made a loud statement that ,  â   Students cannot take law in to  their hands  â   .He also told  the student community  â  if you want to take to the streets  then do not come to us  knocking at our door â   .  This has been conveniently lost on the author of the Editorial. The Editorial has conveniently quoted  another  CJI to make its point . Here too  it is more likely  that it would have picked selectively  from his communication .  The Editorial and the Print media has been deliberately    ignoring and under playing the counter CAA protest across the country. It is bent upon projecting its agenda. It is wantonly  trying to project  as if the entire student community of India  is protesting  , where as  only few pockets  like AMU , Jamia  and JNU  has been witnessing protests  . If you hold a referendum across the universities more than 90 % students will be against the protest.  The protests are being termed anti National not because it is protest against govt policies. Everyone knows that it is being termed anti National because of the anti National sloganeering and acts being done in these protests. Various protests have various ramifications for the country and its well being. The Kashmir  situation cannot be equated with other  political events in a light manner , all those  who were fanning anti  National  elements to retain power  needs to be kept in check  in the interests of the country .The country cannot go on losing its defense and police personnel  endlessly to inimical elements supported by these  politicians .  when country  loses its defense personal  the Editorial observes  total silence .

        "article": "Women are a big reason behind AAP’s runaway success in Delhi, according to a poll-eve survey by Lokniti CSDS. Women were a full 11 percentage points more likely to have voted AAP than BJP. This has been attributed to many causes: AAP’s offer of free public transport, cutting water and electricity bills, and rise in household expenses that was held against BJP. There is speculation that women were less receptive to BJP’s inflammatory “goli maaro” rhetoric and violent crackdown on anti-CAA demonstrators – another reason for the gender gap.Women’s turnout has been growing rapidly in the last two decades, reaching a historic high in the 2019 Lok Sabha election – only 0.4% behind the male turnout – when BJP won its huge mandate. The question of whether women are a distinct enough category, or how they vote, has no glib answers. However, historical election data shows BJP tends to be less popular among women across groups.Some scholarship suggests that women feel more embedded in their group identities, and also that they are overall poorer and more precariously placed. They favour welfare policies attuned to their priorities – the alcohol ban in some states, or policies that reduce their care burden, have been attempts to woo women voters. But whatever the reasons, the Delhi election has shown us a clear divergence in attitudes. All parties should listen more carefully to half the electorate, instead of assuming they are just an extension of male voters. 377 days ago Freebies have played a big role in Indian politics , if  we go by TN, MP and Chhatigarh   elections .

        "date": "February 5, 2020, 9:07 PM  IST",
        "article": "The government has stated in Parliament that it hasn’t taken any decision yet on preparing a National Register of Indian Citizens, but this may not be enough to bridge the political trust deficit. A shelving of the nationwide NRC project, or at least declaring a five-year moratorium pending the generation of greater consensus around it, would have worked better. Given the radical nature of the exercise – in effect, requiring all Indian citizens to prove their citizenship all over again, to the satisfaction of petty bureaucracy – the extent of mistrust it has generated was to be expected. That mistrust is only reinforced by the Assam chapter of NRC being acknowledged to be a failure by all sides including BJP.Some states where opposition parties are in office are now unwilling to proceed with the National Population Register updation, and many others betray uneasiness over the exercise. This is a pity as NPR, which could have been used to strengthen welfare measures, is now falling victim to the CAA-NRC controversy. Unlike UPA which did not pursue NRC after the first NPR exercise in 2010, the NDA government has become a victim of BJP’s powerful hyper-nationalist messaging that jumped the gun by promising a nationwide NRC to follow the controversial CAA it legislated. The Citizenship Rules, 2003, envisage NPR as the staging point for a local and national register of citizens. So it was but natural for critics to link NPR, for which funds were sanctioned in December 2019, to the nationwide NRC that top BJP leaders were promising for several months.It would be useful here to fall back on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s original call for ‘minimum government, maximum governance’, and refocus on the economy that is in dire need of attention. With NRC out of the way, the government will be in a position to recreate optimism around India’s economic prospects.386 days ago With CAA in place and being implemented, NRC can wait. The government must think of a practical way to get rid of illegal immigrants without any collateral damage to the legal Indian citizens. The Supreme Court conducted NRC left a lot to be desired. This should be a clear lesson for the SC to stop assuming the role of the government.

Li Wenliang, a doctor who alerted colleagues on social media, was punished and silenced – later he succumbed to the disease himself. Wuhan wasn’t quarantined till January 23, by which time 5 million people are reported to have already left the city for the Chinese New Year holiday.The reason no one spoke up and precautionary public warnings weren’t issued: governments need to save face and an authoritarian system makes it difficult for subordinates or grassroots workers to pass on bad news to superiors. By contrast, Kerala seems to have done a better job in containing the coronavirus (or Nipah before it), because its health system is based more on trust and sharing information. This should give pause to those who think authoritarianism is justified because it works better.The national capital witnessed unprecedented “goli maaro” rallies recently, and BJP’s comprehensive defeat thereafter couldn’t dissuade UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath from claiming, grossly and insensitively, that protestors shot in UP wanted to die. A school is prosecuted and children interrogated for alleged sedition in Karnataka, for the crime of staging a play criticising CAA – something that even the British Raj, which originated the much abused sedition law, might have stopped short of. Given the growing allure of the authoritarian model, Li Wenliang’s words issued from his deathbed ought to resonate in India: “a healthy society should have more than one kind of voice, and I don’t approve of using public power for excessive interference.” 370 days ago Unrelated, imaginary relation to Indian context.

The cabinet rejected the panel proposed by Delhi police and approved by Baijal, instead tasking the home department to appoint another set of lawyers.

And there is none else to blame. Its conduct during the anti-CAA protests and February riots prompted charges of negligence, outright bias and collusion with one set of rioters. Complaints of police not registering FIRs against BJP netas like Kapil Mishra haven’t helped either. Last week, Delhi HC castigated police for “misusing the judicial system” and “taking the system for a ride”, noting its shoddy probe in attempting to cancel a riot accused school owner’s bail. The same court has also sought copy of a reported top cop note to subordinates to give the probe a communal tilt. Another HC bench had restrained police from selective leaks of allegations against Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita.Trial courts, meanwhile, have granted bail to some riots accused, noting weak or non-existent evidence. Police have appealed these orders in Delhi HC. A representative and accountable government is duty bound to place checks and balances against police overreach. Prosecutors representing the state are charged with doing justice to both victims and accused, and not merely act as police mouthpieces. Delhi police, courts and government must work together to ensure justice is fairly delivered.

        "article": "Union home ministry would do well to heed a parliamentary standing committee that has flagged the need for consensus on the National Population Register update. This follows the ministry indicating that two contentious questions relating to place and date of birth of parents may not be rolled back despite a clutch of opposition-ruled states and even NDA-ruled Bihar not being on board. These questions along with BJP’s electoral rhetoric on CAA and NRC have stoked worries that NPR will become the launchpad for a massive and Kafkaesque bureaucratic exercise ordering people to prove their citizenship.Though government has affirmed that it “has not taken any decision to prepare National Register of Indian Citizens [NRIC] at the national level” the controversy has cast doubt over India’s decennial census exercise. The house listing phase of the census and update of NPR will be carried out across the country from April 1 to September 30. India’s census encompassing over a billion people has been one of its marked achievements, aiding government in economic planning through providing valuable data on demographics and socio-economic status of households and communities.In recent weeks, government surveyors mistaken for NRC enumerators have faced hostility in at least five states. Census surveyors will face a delicate situation having to collect additional items for NPR 2020 like place of last residence, mother tongue, Aadhaar number (voluntary), mobile number, passport number, voter ID card number, driving licence number, date and place of birth of parents. Any backlash could affect the motivation of surveyors and the quality/ integrity of census data. Requiring police backup would be counterproductive, as would reporting inaccurate or fake data. Centre’s insistence on place/ date of birth of parents doesn’t really add much value to the household data it is collecting. Don’t miss the forest for the trees, and imperil the census.353 days ago there is nothing wrong with NPR exercise, it is a must for the country but the way the BJP is trying to bring it the oppositions are  doubting the intention of the Govt.

In literacy levels and school attendance at upper primary, secondary and higher secondary levels, Muslims fare worse than other weaker groups like Dalits and Adivasis or just as bad. 17% of Muslims between ages 3 and 35 had never enrolled in a formal education programme compared to 13.4% of Dalits and 14.7% Adivasis.The findings are a pointer to the social and economic backwardness of the Muslim community. The appeasement politics that BJP accused Congress and other secular parties of practising had run its course by 2014. Instead of continuing to raise old slogans, it is time to launch new schemes. A community falling behind doesn’t behove well for India’s development or growth trajectory. Educational avenues have helped India overcome the history of caste inequities and is helping hitherto backward communities join the mainstream.

        "date": "February 5, 2020, 7:51 AM  IST",
        "article": "After an eventful first term political startup AAP is seeking votes again on the basis of its governance record, while BJP is going all out to unseat it. Until about mid-2017 AAP and BJP constantly baited each other, as a consequence of which governance had suffered since the structure of authority in the national capital is a divided one. Since then chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to have kept his head down, toned down the theatrics and focussed on administration – perhaps out of a realisation that voters will tire of the constant search for enemies and demand results.It’s to his credit that he sees his government’s primary job as delivering on education and health – areas that have been traditionally under-emphasised by India’s political class. BJP, however, has had plenty of opportunity to dissect Kejriwal’s claims and question his purported successes on these and other governance related areas, and it’s a little surprising that the principal opposition party hasn’t made full use of that opportunity. Rather than Kejriwal’s performance BJP has bet big on making the elections a mandate on Shaheen Bagh, even if painting AAP and Shaheen Bagh protesters with the same brush is a bit of a stretch. This has occurred in the midst of hate fuelled shootings, campus violence and gross incompetence in policing.Kejriwal has kept his distance from the protests and placed the onus for resolution on the Centre, with its control over police and traffic. By supporting Article 370 nullification, opposing CAA, and focussing on work done by his government, AAP has staked out a middle ground in the last couple of years. BJP’s campaign, by contrast, places a premium on national security in a local election. This is a novel plank, and it’s anybody’s guess how Delhi’s electorate responds in an assembly election to issues not of local roads, hospitals or plumbing, but of an abstract nationalism that consists of taking on spectral enemies who occasionally morph into the figures of opposition parties and leaders, if not Shaheen Bagh protesters.BJP’s strategy has, for instance, resulted in attempts to characterise Kejriwal as a “terrorist”. Some have seen in the strategy a way of energising its core cadre while getting out the Hindu vote. If this strategy succeeds, it will have ramifications for future elections as well. We will know by next Tuesday, when results are declared.387 days ago Master stroke by Mr Kejriwal, his bundle of freebies offered before election has been a big hit with majority low income voters,  Likely to sweep the poll.

        "date": "February 12, 2020, 8:06 AM  IST",
        "article": "Aam Aadmi Party has pulled off the unthinkable in the national capital: an emphatic mandate that’s almost as sweeping as its phenomenal 2015 victory. The scale of AAP’s win is also a rebuke to BJP and its hyperbolic Hindus-in-danger refrain. While AAP’s election campaign focussed squarely on its governance record, BJP failed to avail of plenty of opportunities to pick holes in that record. Instead, in an assembly election, BJP’s rhetoric focussed more on Pakistan than the state of local drains. It also demonised opponents and embarked on a polarising campaign marked by rage and negativity, which Delhi’s electorate has conclusively rejected.In fact, Kejriwal has arguably appropriated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s playbook to turn the tables on BJP. In this election Kejriwal’s slogan could well have been “sabka saath, sabka vikas”, as he went on a personalised campaign emphasising welfarist measures, calling for popular involvement in government schemes, emphasising his Hindu identity. At the same time BJP appeared to have picked up on strands of agitationist and radical politics, to which it added an incendiary edge with its unprecedented “goli maaro” rallies, or suggestion that a women-led, peaceful agitation concerned about revocation of citizenship rights was out to “rape and kill”.That hyper-nationalist pitch failed to carry conviction with the educated, cosmopolitan and aspirational electorate of the national capital, whose syncretic culture built over centuries is part of its identity. Alongside BJP’s failures, AAP was also greatly helped by Congress belying BJP’s hopes of a triangular contest in Delhi. Congress’s central leadership sent out signals that the party had little skin in the game, pre-empting a split in anti-BJP votes. BJP’s relentless demonisation of Congress may have led Congress to conclude that its first priority was stopping BJP, even at the cost of sliding into irrelevance in one more state.BJP too has its share of worries, as the reputations of PM Modi and Amit Shah as deft political strategists have come into question in recent months. Big misfires include an awkward, short-lived alliance with Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra after a fallout with old ally Shiv Sena, going solo in Jharkhand without AJSU and falling short, incessantly promising an NRC to follow CAA which has provoked nationwide unrest as it raises the spectre of petty bureaucracy being given the power to declare anyone a non-citizen, and now the failed polarising strategy for Delhi. If that strategy is a rehearsal for elections in Bengal, then Delhi’s lesson is that BJP cannot hope to woo voters with a negative and polarising campaign having potential to stoke violence. For one, Bengal’s voters are sick of political violence. For another, voters are now clearly making a distinction between national and local issues.380 days ago CAA/NRC was not an issue with most of the voters or else Congress candidates would not have lost their deposits.

        "date": "February 24, 2020, 8:03 PM  IST",
        "article": "There are clear parallels between the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ event in Houston last year, staged at the NRG stadium that plays host most often to National Football League (NFL) matches, and US President Donald Trump’s reception yesterday at Ahmedabad’s Motera stadium. Much like the crowds that Prime Minister Narendra Modi draws, Trump was cheered on by 1,25,000 people in India’s largest cricket stadium. From an Indian point of view, fears that Trump would veer off script proved unfounded as he gave the democratic India story a big thumbs up.On Pakistan, Trump said his administration was working with Islamabad to crack down on terror organisations on the Pakistani border. He prefaced this by saying India and the US were firmly united to defend their citizens from radical Islamic terrorism. The statements seem to balance India’s concerns about Pakistan-origin terror with America’s desire to do a deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan. India’s concern, of course, is that it shouldn’t be cornered by the China-Pakistan axis, and powerful friends like Washington can prevent it from getting isolated. In that context, soft diplomacy of the sort witnessed at Motera or Agra yesterday can prepare the ground for negotiating thorny issues that remain between the two countries.Trump said that a very big trade deal was in the works, and the fact that he is being accompanied by a high-powered delegation, including US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, holds out hope of serious negotiations. After all, American protectionist tariffs have hit India hard in recent times, preventing the bilateral relationship from reaching its full potential. India too should be flexible and become a more open market. Aside from clinching an important trade deal, it will help the Indian economy itself to grow.Meanwhile, Trump also asserted that India had always been admired around the world as a place where multiple religions worship in harmony. Perhaps there is a subtle message here – India is known throughout the world for its diversity, its respect for individual freedom and for freedom of religion, and those are assets worth preserving. Today will see if Trump gets more explicit and brings up the discriminatory CAA or the burdensome NRC.367 days ago Aman ki asha brigade timmes network talking abt pakistan !!

        "article": "On a day when US President Donald Trump hailed India’s unity, diversity, communal harmony, respect for rule of law and dignity of every human being, communal rioting in Delhi posed searching questions on all those fronts. Delhi Police, in particular, has much to answer for. Woefully unprepared for the violence that raged across northeast Delhi, the police put some of its own personnel’s lives at risk by deploying too few men to take on rioters. Quite a few videos also pointed to partisan conduct by police.Ominous signs were visible as early as Sunday noon when BJP leader Kapil Mishra led a mob supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act to confront anti-CAA protesters and both sides pelted stones in the hours following Mishra’s provocative remarks. At least ten lives have been lost and scores injured including journalists in the line of duty, because of Delhi Police’s monumental incompetence. At the first signs of trouble, a more professional police force would have intensified patrolling, convened peace committees and ramped up intelligence. Sadly, not in the national capital.The Union home ministry, exercising administrative control over Delhi Police, cannot skirt responsibility. Despite several failures over the course of his blemished stint as police commissioner, it granted Amulya Patnaik an extension last month. The most ghastly among these saw students of famous campuses like JNU and Jamia coming under attack with police facing charges of omission and commission. Even yesterday, early media reports pointed to police missing in (in)action in some riot affected neighbourhoods.The spectre of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots has always loomed uncomfortably over the capital city and for this reason many believed it would not permit another large-scale riot. More so on a day when India would like to showcase its capabilities as a leading democratic power. Politicians must introspect for this failure, which has shamed India before the world. Not only has Delhi Police been badly led, the role of politicians in sowing the current climate of discord, with incendiary rhetoric polarising communities and casting opponents as traitors, is reprehensible. East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir has rightly demanded action against those making provocative remarks irrespective of party lines, including his party colleague Mishra. The Modi government must restore order in Delhi and correct the creeping distrust of state agencies in minority communities. The Supreme Court taking note of CAA’s discriminatory provisions would also help. 366 days ago Let the Modi detractors be informed, CAA is a closed chapter.

        "article": "Completing a hundred days is hardly a milestone for a state government, but when the sarkar is such that it has a Hindutva hardliner for a chief minister and two sworn ‘secularist’ organisations as his alliance partners, it’s no surprise that many in Maharashtra think the Maha Vikas Aghadi government might as well take some credit for itself for having survived for over two months. But now that there is some acknowledgement not only from the opposition BJP but from allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress themselves that the coalition could be workable, it’s time for Maharashtra’s still-new rulers to get down seriously to business and not pat themselves on the back for just having kept the Aghadi’s ship somehow afloat.The internal contradictions have been there for all to see. The controversy over the Elgar Parishad case has still not gone away, with Sharad Pawar demanding a special investigation team, CM Uddhav Thackeray deflecting the matter by handing over the case to NIA, then Pawar’s outfit trying to claw its way back by talking of exploring ways in which the state could still carry out an independent inquiry. The ideological incongruities have also been apparent over the Sena’s open support for CAA and NPR and Congress and NCP’s stiff opposition to CAA-NRC-NPR, with a temporary compromise having been worked out by way of appointing a panel that will look into the NRC and NPR issues.The first state budget presented by finance minister Ajit Pawar last week allows both NCP and Sena to focus on their respective constituencies in the Mumbai-Konkan region and western Maharashtra. Yet whether these areas truly see an economic and social revival or not is the key at a time when the state’s debt projection for 2020-21 is at Rs 5.2 lakh crore. Once India’s industrial powerhouse, Maharashtra suffers with its industrial and manufacturing sectors hitting new lows, its farmers reeling under debt despite one loan waiver after another and its youngsters hoping for promised jobs.While Mumbai, Konkan and western Maharashtra could do with a push, there is no way the state could end its longstanding farm crisis and sort out other pressing issues without giving equal status to the other three long-neglected regions of the state – Vidarbha, Marathwada and northern Maharashtra. If the real cause is Maha-rashtra and not only the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s survival, things could indeed change.352 days ago Shiv Sena wants power and the Congress and NCP want to loot public money.

While home minister Amit Shah is leading a typical hardline campaign by foregrounding the CAA, nationalism and AAP’s ambivalence towards the Shaheen Bagh protests, others like UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union minister of state Anurag Thakur and local MP Parvesh Sahib Verma have exceeded limits and made hate speeches.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-132428 size-large\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amit-Shah-1024x638.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amit-Shah-1024x638.jpg 1024w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amit-Shah-300x187.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amit-Shah-768x478.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amit-Shah-52x32.jpg 52w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\">As if on cue from such speeches, the area around Shaheen Bagh, where protests have now crossed 50 days, has seen three shootings in four days. Delhi Police’s inept handling—cutting a sorry figure during the first shooting incident by an alleged juvenile—appears to have emboldened more fringe elements. The police, already facing flak for failing to stop the attack on teachers and students in JNU or take penal action afterwards, cannot afford to let the situation slide any further.To prevent a more serious situation from developing heads have to roll but Delhi top cop Amulya Patnaik, who has had a forgettable stint, has been granted an extension. Elections are a time for people to assess the work done by their government over the past five years. Political violence, especially during elections, is dangerous because it sows the seeds of fear in voters, undermines democracy and distracts from real issues.

        "article": "The Delhi assembly election is around the corner, on February 8, and BJP hasn’t tasted success here since 1993. In pole position is incumbent AAP, but BJP has fielded nonentity Sunil Yadav against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. So what is the BJP’s game plan?Certainly the capital has plenty of civic woes that the opposition can capitalize on – from an annual crisis of winter air pollution and chronic garbage affliction to shortage of public buses and lack of women’s safety. On all these fronts the AAP government can be put on the mat for poor leadership. These are also issues intimately felt in citizens’ everyday lives. But in a queer choice, BJP seems to be plumping the Pakistan card instead.BJP’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra, who has been seen sloganeering “desh ke gaddaaron ko, goli maaron saalon ko” in pro-CAA protests, has now declared that on February 8 “there will be a contest on Delhi roads between India and Pakistan.” Union home minister and former BJP chief Amit Shah has kicked off his poll campaign in Delhi by clubbing both Kerjriwal and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi with Pakistan PM Imran Khan: “They speak in the same tune. What relationship do they share?”The claim that those who are questioning the Centre’s policies are being treasonous is untenable. Rather, as former President Pranab Mukherjee said yesterday, “Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent.” BJP should challenge AAP’s policies and governance report card. It should offer better alternatives. That’s the kind of political competition that delivers growth and development. Communal dog-whistles will only pull us all down a septic rabbit hole.399 days ago indeed B J P must concentrate on civic woes known as A A P , which shamelessly throws freebies.defeat A A P        "

        "date": "February 3, 2020, 7:41 AM  IST",
        "article": "In a welcome move, foreign minister S Jaishankar is undertaking a big restructuring exercise to make his ministry more nimble and responsive to strategic issues. The ministry is creating a series of verticals like economic and trade diplomacy, development partnership, and emerging areas like technology. Each of these verticals will be headed by the equivalent of a political director at the additional secretary level. The aim is to separate routine foreign policy work from strategic projects.There’s no denying that India’s foreign policy environment has become more complex, as China’s meteoric rise has significantly altered global dynamics. And given that China shares an all-weather relationship with Pakistan, Indian foreign policy needs to be shaken out of its old non-aligned lethargy. In this regard, economic and trade diplomacy is key as growing protectionism means India has to work extra hard to do beneficial trade deals and free trade agreements. In fact, the economic and trade diplomacy vertical will be critical to boosting India’s strategic heft in the years ahead.However, all of this will come to naught if the domestic policy environment isn’t aligned with foreign policy objectives. India can no longer describe itself as the world’s fastest growing major economy. It will be exceedingly difficult to make up for the loss of diplomatic heft consequent to India’s current economic slump with any conceivable dexterity on the part of Indian diplomats. Alongside the loss of hard power is the slide in soft power, with the line between dissent and treason being blurred at home and India acquiring an increasing reputation abroad of authoritarianism and majoritarianism. For example, if India is to work closely with the US and the West to counter the China-Pakistan axis, it doesn’t help to undermine secular, democratic values. The impending EU vote on CAA exemplifies this point. Domestic and foreign policy can’t work in separate silos.389 days ago The problem lies in follow through and implementation. Ideas and concepts sound good on paper but demonstrable change in quick time is critical. This Govt frowns upon experts with domain knowledge and solely depends on babudom.

        "date": "January 30, 2020, 7:55 AM  IST",
        "article": "While campaigning for Delhi assembly polls BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Verma expressed his ire for the Shaheen Bagh protesters – led by women, many of them senior citizens – in an extraordinary and outlandish fashion: He claimed they would enter houses of Delhi voters to “rape and kill”, unless voters plumped for BJP. This amounts to hate speech and incitement to violence; such speech must be barred by the Election Commission. Likewise, Union minister Anurag Thakur does not deserve to campaign further in these elections, as he invoked a violent slogan from pro-CAA rallies by chanting “Desh ke gaddaron ko” (Traitors of the country), egging on the crowd to complete the chant with “Goli maaron saalon ko” (Shoot the bastards). In this context, claiming that he did not himself demand that protesters be shot is a mere legalistic defence.EC has issued a gentle reprimand by revoking their names from BJP’s “star campaigner” list. It only signifies that if the duo campaigns, then the individual candidates and not the party will pick up the tab for their electioneering expenses. Both Thakur and Verma were inciting violence and promoting enmity against Shaheen Bagh protesters, offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code. Without a strong deterrent, others will also try their hand at hate speech. Even bigger names like Amit Shah, Azam Khan, Yogi Adityanath and Mayawati were barred from past campaigns. So EC mustn’t hold back against Thakur/ Verma.Moreover, the eagerness to deny agency to the Shaheen Bagh women isn’t becoming of BJP. While criminalising triple talaq, the party had claimed it was empowering Muslim women. Shaheen Bagh’s spirited recitation of the Constitution’s Preamble and celebrations of patriotism should be sweet music for those worrying about fissiparous tendencies. By targeting them, instead, BJP ends up sending the message that it will never accept them as part of the republic. It must reflect on whether this is the message it really wants to send to India’s Muslims, and whether it is good for the country.Meanwhile, sedition cases are becoming the norm against those opposing government policies. Look no further than the Karnataka school play criticising CAA inviting a sedition case. BJP must reconnect with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s immensely successful ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ slogan, to which he later added ‘sabka vishwas’. It also falls upon institutions such as the EC and courts to uphold the framework and dignity of Indian democracy.393 days ago Yet another one-sided nonsensical editorial. As if the Shaheenbag crowd is made of sadhus, sadhavis, and sants. What about Sharjeel Imam, or those who beat up a media person, or the likes of MS Aiyar? You kept quite on these folks but identified two BJP guys to highlight in your daily dose of anti-CAA editorials/articles? What about the obstruction and nuisance these Shaheenbagis are causing and for what? Just their hatred for Hindus? You are essentially promoting hatred for Hindus, plain and simple. When someone says \"Goli maaron gaddaron ko\" why do you assume that they are Muslims? Also, Mr. Verma's comment about Muslims raping Delhites must be seen in the context of what is happening in Pakistan and what happened in J&K? Whenever the Muslims are in majority, they think that the women of the other communities belong to them and can be raped and plundered. Do you support that? Since you bring up women rights and triple talaq, if you have the guts, write an editorial on the evil practice of polygamy that is allowed legally in India to appease the Muslim men even when everyone knows that that is so demeaning to women and no other civilized country in the world allows that....

He has asked why the women and children sitting in Shaheen Bagh were not dying, despite cold temperatures. Previously, he had praised the police in BJP-governed states like UP for shooting anti-CAA demonstrators “like dogs”. And now, after his workers heckled a lone woman protester, he said she was lucky that “worse things” hadn’t happened to her.This is a threat of force against anyone who dares to protest, and implicit encouragement to his boys that they are free to do “worse” to women protesters. Meanwhile, in Delhi, we have seen how BJP functionaries like Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and MoS finance Anurag Thakur gave vent to inflammatory slogans about their adversaries. Days after, a young man intoxicated by their ideology actually opened fire on barricaded, peacefully demonstrating students at Jamia Millia Islamia who had, at the time, been marking the day of Gandhi’s assassination.This anger against Muslims, students, activists, liberals or anyone who opposes the ruling party has been steadily stoked and nurtured. It must stop now. Opposing ideas should be debated, and subjected to withering criticism if need be. But those holding them cannot be simply intimidated or coerced into submission. Portraying dissenters as traitors can only come at grave cost to the republic. We stand at a crossroads today.

Even the JNU leftists thugs, who violently would not let student register for classes, are being shown as victims. Why? This youngster at Jamia could not take it any more and snapped. There is also a good likelihood of this person being an AAP implant. Irrespective of whether the person is an AAP implant or a youth who snapped due to the intolerant media coverage and daily Jamia/Shaheenbag drama, violence of any kind is bad. However, this newspaper shamelessly reports selectively. There is no coverage of the youth attending a pro-CAA rally being killed by stone pelters from a mosque. Violence incited by Mullahs, especially after Friday \"prayers\", is considered to be perfectly normal and they even try to justify it. When Sharjeel Imam talks about breaking India's neck, they show sob stories about his family and his mom, his educational background, etc. How long will this joke continue?

If governments are to treat those opposed to their policies as Ghosh has prescribed, even BJP activists like Ghosh would be in great danger wherever they are in opposition. By advocating murder and inhuman treatment of protesters, Ghosh has proved himself unworthy of occupying a leadership position in a democracy.Ghosh must be sacked forthwith, failing which BJP will be doing immense damage to its own campaign to drum up support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. After all, showing tolerance to dissent is what India’s Constitution envisages and Indian democracy is all about. If Ghosh threatens merely to shoot protesters, it will be presumed that BJP has no better arguments for CAA. Indeed, it’s hard to recall vitriol like Ghosh’s even during India’s infamous Emergency. If the country comes to a standstill because of prevailing polarisation, BJP’s interests will be hurt the most as the electorate will hold the ruling establishment to account for breakdown in governance. Yet extremist rhetoric such as Ghosh’s will only sharpen distrust, foreclosing any meeting ground between government and opposition. This is not how a mainstream party, let alone a party in office, speaks.BJP has great ambitions for as well as a wonderful opportunity in Bengal – given current misrule in the state.

However, since then several issues have hindered the neighbourhood outreach. The 2015-16 Nepal blockade saw a massive dip in ties with Kathmandu, which are yet to regain the level of trust that existed before. Meanwhile, the 2017 Doklam standoff with China made complications for our ties with Bhutan. And while we now have a seemingly friendly regime in the Maldives, our ties with Sri Lanka after the recent election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa as President have entered a cautious phase.Meanwhile, we have largely had great relations with Bangladesh over the last five years. But government’s Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens have created disquiet in Dhaka. The anti-illegal Bangladeshi migrants rhetoric that BJP leaders are indulging in is making things uncomfortable for the friendly Sheikh Hasina dispensation.Against this backdrop, it is wise that the Modi government is bringing the focus back on the neighbourhood. Besides, China is already waiting in the wings to increase its own influence in South Asian nations. If New Delhi is serious about treating this region as its strategic backyard, it must do more to allay neighbours’ perception that India doesn’t care about their interests.

This is the American company that fronted the personal computing revolution of the last century but then hit a slump, until getting its mojo back under Nadella, and rising to trillion dollar market capitalisation. He is a hero to India’s aspiring youth and this week he had tough words for the policy that many of these youth have been protesting over the last month. Answering an interview question on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 he said, “It’s just bad.”In explanation, Nadella added that if anything he would love to see a Bangladeshi immigrant coming to India and creating the next unicorn here, or becoming CEO of Infosys. This is the sensibility that for long made America the shining city on the hill – giving giant opportunities to the immigrants of the world and seeing monumental wealth creation in exchange. But a very different mood prevails in the world today, as also in India. The enlightened view of immigration is shrinking.BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi is among those who have set out to school Nadella. But she made a booboo of it. After repeating the government position that CAA is about granting opportunities to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, she sarcastically suggested that the US should grant such opportunities to Syrian Muslims instead of Yazidis. Actually none other than Steve Jobs’s biological father was a Syrian Muslim immigrant. Immigration has in fact been the umbilical cord of the entire Silicon Valley ecosystem. And its tech barons have taken a decisive stand against parsing immigration on religious lines – including against the Trump administration’s ‘Muslim ban’, which compares to how CAA includes six religions but excludes Islam.In 2018 a study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that 55% of the country’s $1 billion startups had at least one immigrant founder. Diversity reaps great business benefits; this is now part of global MBA curriculums.

Nadda’s elevation has been in the making for some time and comes almost seven months after he was made the working president. That responsibility was given to him when Shah was made the Union home minister after BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. BJP’s internal rules state that a person can’t hold more than one post, whether in party or government. That Nadda has risen unopposed also indicates the degree of trust reposed in him by the prime minister, home minister and other top functionaries of the party. Plus, it lessens the load on Shah who can now devote his full energy to the home ministry.Of course Nadda has very big shoes to fill. Under Shah’s presidency BJP has seen unprecedented expansion. Not only has the party membership expanded manifold since 2014, Shah is credited with creating an electoral juggernaut that has steamrolled through the length and breadth of the country. His astute electoral management, including the introduction of panna pramukhs, has been the perfect foil for PM Narendra Modi’s charisma.Nadda has to first consolidate all that BJP has achieved while facing a slew of new challenges that include anti-incumbency against BJP in the states. The party lost Jharkhand, was unable to form government in Maharashtra and just about made it in Haryana. There’s also ally trouble with many BJP partners uncomfortable with the party’s aggressive approach, particularly on controversial issues like CAA and NRC. A key question is whether Nadda will seek to soften BJP’s image and achieve a better working relationship with allies. It also remains to be gauged if he will have a free hand or Shah will continue as de facto president.402 days ago Everyone would wish the new President success.

An economy in serious trouble, which the IMF, long an admirer, has said is a drag on the global economy.

        "article": "The constitutionality of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act must be fast decided by Supreme Court in the wake of the widespread protests that it has provoked. Centre has shown no intention of altering CAA provisions and it falls upon SC to restore the primacy of constitutional values. CAA as passed by Parliament has an inherent bias against Muslims. The apex court has given the government four more weeks to respond to the petitions against CAA. The government will use this time to come up with a case that the changes in citizenship law are not violative of the Constitution. Critics have so far not found the arguments in favour of CAA convincing. The chief justification for the controversial law is that it provides relief to minorities of six religions living as illegal migrants in India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan – where Islam is the state religion. But this has contradictions.For instance, Buddhism is Sri Lanka’s state religion and thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils are languishing as illegal migrants in India for several years. Their exclusion in this mass citizenship drive is inexplicable.Perhaps the Centre means to make a distinction between nations that have a state religion and those gripped by religious fundamentalism (such as Pakistan). The notion that it is only the non-Islamic minorities who face persecution in Pakistan is flawed. Arguably, religious fundamentalists target the “apostate” who is considered a deviant from the state religion – like Ahmadiyyas in Pakistan – with even greater fervour than the non-believing “infidel”. Even Baloch nationalists whose cause India espouses, Bangladeshi atheists, or Myanmar’s Rohingyas fleeing various shades of persecution may be living as illegal migrants in our midst but don’t make the cut under CAA. In Bangladesh, secular bloggers have been killed while in Afghanistan Hazra Shias have been targeted by Taliban.Under the Citizenship Act’s naturalisation process for legally entering aliens 2,830 people from Pakistan, 912 from Afghanistan and 172 from Bangladesh, many of them Muslims, were granted citizenship in the past six years. Extending this naturalisation facility to illegal migrants fleeing persecution, irrespective of country and religion, would be both humane and in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution. This will help mend the CAA-engineered gaping hole in India’s secular fabric, and repair the damage that India’s soft power has suffered because of a law which is deviation from founding fathers’ conception and sense of who we should be as a people.399 days ago Your argument about Sri Lankan Tamils is orthogonal to the current CAA. The current CAA does not preclude adding Sri Lankan Tamils in the future. The current CAA is only about the Hindus and other minorities persecuted in three neighboring MUSLIM countries. Is it that hard to understand or you would continue to sing the song that does not end? India cannot and must not allow illegal Muslim immigrants from anywhere. There are plenty of Muslims republics of all sects, shapes, and sizes to choose from. Yes, India should allow legal immigration that it has done by allowing a large number of Pakistanis, mostly Muslims, to immigrate to India. For these pseudo-secular jokers among the editors, India is all about Muslims. Poor Hindus should get killed, butchered, raped, maimed, it would not matter to these jokers. Also, regarding Ahmediyas, have you checked with the Khan market gang if they would be allowed in India? There will 100 editorials written on why allowing Ahmediyas in India would be anti-Islamic!...

        "date": "January 29, 2020, 9:30 AM  IST",
        "article": "In a welcome development, a tripartite agreement has been inked between the Centre, Assam government and Bodo representatives, including all factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the All Bodo Students’ Union. The accord aims at ending the 34 year long Bodo movement in Assam that killed 4,000 people and saw several rounds of ethnic tension. Importantly, the latest accord – it is actually the third agreement signed with the Bodos till date – sees Bodo outfits dropping their demand for a separate state in favour of more autonomy and development assistance.In this respect, the Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD) will be reconstituted by including new Bodo-dominated villages and excluding those with predominantly non-tribal populations. Bodo language will be notified as an associate official language and over 1,500 NDFB men will surrender arms on January 30 and disband their outfits. Plus, Rs 1,500 crore shall be released over the next three years for Bodo areas. While all of this is positive, the accord doesn’t factor in one critical fact – that the majority in the designated Bodo areas are non-Bodos. Even if the BTAD is reconfigured, this fact is unlikely to change. And with land being at the core of the Bodo movement, not bringing on board the non-Bodo population could see a repeat of ethnic tensions down the line.That said, if the accord delivers what it promises, it would lead to the end of one of Northeast’s long running insurgencies. But for the Northeast to truly enjoy fruits of peace and development, and become a bridge between India and Southeast Asia under New Delhi’s Act East policy, other insurgency movements too need a negotiated settlement. The big one of course is the Naga peace talks which seem to have stalled after New Delhi signed a framework agreement with Naga group NSCN (I-M) in August 2015. Integration of all Naga homelands, and the use of Naga flag and constitution – called Yezhabo – are sticking points here.But what comes as an additional obstacle to Northeast peace in recent months is BJP’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act or (CAA) push, against which Assam is protesting and which has the potential to revive dying separatist movements. For example, it could give the non-talks faction of Ulfa a handle. Thus, BJP would do well to avoid moves like CAA that could light new fires in the Northeast.394 days ago Stop lying. Assam is not protesting. It is only the frustrated Congresswallahs and Hindu-haters who are protesting.

        "date": "January 7, 2020, 7:51 AM  IST",
        "article": "Masked goons wrought violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday night. The visuals of terrified students leaving their campus, thugs bearing rods and lathis on the rampage, power lines snapped, with policemen watching as mute spectators seemed surreal. But it was all too real. This is one of India’s best known universities, which has allowed a tense standoff between university administration and a Left-backed students union to linger too long. For a start, the Union HRD ministry needs to put its crown jewels in better hands. The university peremptorily blaming the violence on a select group of students who have been challenging its polices, cannot distract from vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar’s incompetence.As students from Puducherry to Oxford protest in solidarity with JNU students, the university administration and Delhi police have much to answer. Why did the administrators not push for proper police action the very moment masked intruders with weapons were seen on campus? The office of Delhi’s deputy commissioner of police (south-west district) is right across the JNU campus and yet the sizeable contingent of police personnel or their supervisors didn’t intervene in time. If police waited for further word from the administration to enter, even as masked goons were attacking students, such misplaced sensitivities would be sweet music for vigilantes.The cruel irony that no ‘permission’ was needed to enter Jamia Millia Islamia or wield disproportionate force on unarmed students there, is too recent to be forgotten. No less grievous was the police failure to maintain law and order outside JNU gates on Sunday night. With medical personnel also attacked while police idled, Indian Medical Association has decried the shocking state of law and order in Delhi. Cabinet ministers and JNU alumni Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar too have condemned the violence.Yet the closing of ranks will help only when concrete action materialises and police unmasks the perpetrators. So far the policing failures reflect poorly on Union home ministry, which oversees policing in the capital. The opportunity to stop the mob in their tracks was squandered on Sunday night. Now clues like phone numbers in right-wing WhatsApp groups allegedly created to foment violence and cellphone footage must be probed punctiliously. Meanwhile the masked stormtroopers at JNU have cast further international ignominy on an India reeling from nationwide anti-CAA-NRC protests. Beyond this, fear shouldn’t enter universities as it has in Jamia, AMU, JNU in recent weeks; they are India’s best hope for braving 21st century’s bewildering developmental, technological and environmental challenges.416 days ago Law and order situation was not bad  until Congress/Left/Intellectual-sponsored,  Islamofascist-led mobs started disrupting public life in the name of democracy via burning  protests.  Editors/bloggers in these editorial space have been promoting these protests with pride. When five-ten thousand people take matters on the roads, they are too many for law and order situation. Showing them as a dance of democracy when million other people opposed to their ideas, who decided to vote peacefully and stay home, is actually an insult to democracy. Police was nonchalantly criticized for entering Jamia without permission. May be that's why they decided to wait out until called. You can not have both ways-damned if they enter, damned  if they don't. The fire that is started by leftist/intellectuals  is going to burn the country. Don't wish that right wingers won't start burning when their parties start loosing. It would be natural result of your actions....

        "article": "Such is the Indian appetite for holding aloft the tricolour that Hyderabad has already run out of flag supplies, with Republic Day still two weeks away. From citizens opposing CAA-NRC to those in support, everyone’s been waving the national flag lately. Politicians and intellectuals speechify endlessly about nationalism but the tricolour in the ordinary citizen’s hand does the job so much more reassuringly. On mass scale, the spectacle is elevating. Of course there are also those who espouse violence flag in hand. But the tiranga was designed to suggest that it is moral values like truth and dharma that illuminate India’s civilisational quest.The tricolour’s journey from flagpoles and government buildings to handheld glory parallels the rise of colour TV in India. Recall the singular tricolour among fans mobbing the 1983 World Cup winning team at Lords or the children in saffron, white and green who run in flag formation at the end of Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, telecast first on Independence Day in 1988. Or the vicarious pleasure in watching the tricolour emblazoned on Sachin Tendulkar’s iconic helmet.Of course, it also helped that the state’s parsimonious rationing of flag hoisting days for private individuals was finally broken by Supreme Court ruling in 2004 that this violated the fundamental right to free expression. From cloth, paper and polluting plastic, our national flag’s trendiest avatar has been as body art. Those dabbing their face and bodies in tricoloured paint need have no shame – unlike those who carelessly dump their flags after first use, leaving the conscientious few to clean up the streets after them. Keep in mind also the poorest face in the crowd, selling the flag at stadiums, protests and rajpaths to earn a square meal a day. She is the tiranga’s luckless child.413 days ago Seeing the national flag held aloft, often accompanied by readings from the Preamble, has given a whole new meaning to nationalism.

        "article": "The first two generations born after World War II are largely holding fort in governments everywhere. These leaders may believe they have spurred economic growth, avoided costly wars and upheld national interests but young people are immensely discontented. Against their worries about climate change, rising education expenses and shrinking job avenues they get xenophobic political responses. Immigration is demonised, trade ties are breaking, and dissent is being met with authoritarianism. This wide global arc of populist nationalism vs youth protests has touched India too and testing times beckon.One may disagree with the specific prescriptions of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg or JNU student leader Aishe Ghosh. But their spirited questioning of the establishment is the zeitgeist. Students are marching on the streets because they see the current course of action as jeopardising their future. They’re adulting where the adults have disappointed. The diminutive Aishe, head bandaged, left arm in cast, two FIRs weighing her down, wants to answer her attackers’ iron rods only with democratic debate. A university must indeed be a space for thinking minds to lock horns, peacefully. But ironically violence, not dissent, seems to be getting a free pass since Sunday.Governments mustn’t discourage dissent. As Supreme Court said, it’s democracy’s safety valve. A young person’s ‘Free Kashmir’ placard in a Mumbai protest is no challenge to India but should remind Indians of Kashmir’s unending internet shutdown – and how it has handicapped education there. Actually, the peaceful anti-CAA-NRC protests, with their vibrant creativity and joyful odes to the Constitution, would be a moment of pride for any mature democracy. When Deepika Padukone bowed to Aishe, it underlined that even the younger Bollywood is cast in a different mould than the old order. The women stand out.Institutions, meanwhile, are slow to respond. Whether it is government or police or university authorities. But let’s be clear, actions that harm higher education will hurt India’s future deeply. Nobel-winning JNU alumnus Abhijit Banerjee credits the “extremely unregulated freedom” on US campuses for spurring success. Here, the outrages of Leftism that suppressed alternative voices are being replicated by those seeking to impose Hindutva hegemony instead. Not devolving autonomy to public campuses has proved a costly mistake. Fossilised structures have fallen further and further behind in global competition. Getting off this reverse gear is an urgent task. It needs ditching the remote control, better funding models, higher academic standards. And listening to the students.414 days ago I agree with with the editor that youth are the future.  But they can not be the future by holding an university to a ransom, preventing the ones who really want to become the future, from registering to their course and pursue their studies.I am surprised to see the praise heaped on one individual who is responsible for this...

        "date": "January 12, 2020, 7:20 PM  IST",
        "article": "Following the Centre’s notification of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) last Friday, already intense protests against it have stepped up further in Assam. Meanwhile, as many as 61 petitions have been filed in different high courts against the discriminatory nature of the Act, arguing that it violates basic constitutional principles. The Supreme Court has issued notice to all petitioners for a consolidated hearing in the apex court. SC’s recent Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid judgment has been described as pragmatic, in that it severely strictured the demolition of the mosque yet awarded the site to those who want to build a Ram temple. On the CAA issue the apex court has an opportunity to pass a judgment that’s pragmatic, constitutional, and swiftly restores peace by foreclosing an issue causing mass anxiety, division and strife in society at large.A group of 106 former civil servants, including a former National Security Adviser, have penned an open letter critiquing CAA, and the legislative framework underpinning the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC). They make a compelling case by highlighting how these legislations enable arbitrary exercise of power by the bureaucracy. NPR is not linked to the decadal Census; it flows from the powers conferred by the Citizenship Act and can serve as a master document to prepare a register of citizens. Given that other documents such as passports and voter cards evidence citizenship, there is no compelling reason to carry out yet another exercise to prepare a citizens’ register.Indeed, the notified rules which detail the process are deeply flawed. They endow junior bureaucracy with enormous powers; documents evidencing citizenship can be set aside. Add to that CAA’s discriminatory character. By excluding a major religion, CAA violates fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.SC can devise an elegant solution to cut the unseemly Gordian knot of legislation now roiling the country, by ruling CAA ultra vires of the Constitution on these grounds. Without CAA the NDA would be forced to drop a nationwide NRC, as otherwise its rigours would fall equally on all sections of the population, including those whose votes it needs. With many states refusing to co-operate in these pointless exercises, the federal character of India’s polity would be restored. And BJP would have reason to be happy too, as it would have a face saving way of backing out of an unworkable impasse. It would be a win-win resolution for all.410 days ago For these editorial board jokers, and those 106 so called eminent people (even bigger jokers), it is all about Muslims. The persecuted and ravaged Hindus in the neighboring Muslim countries do not mean anything to them. These same folks cried so many tears for the Rohingyas. The Supreme Court was right in its judgement on the Ram Janmabhumi case. So the very premise of your stupid argument is wrong. The Supreme Court should continue to pass judgements that indeed provide justice and not listen to these editors or the people of eminence. It should stay away from legal, legislative actions. The CAA became an act by a huge majority in both houses of the parliament. These jokers seem to ignore that fact. In fact, instead of supporting the democratic and humanitarian CAA, these Hindu haters are harming India through dirty, intolerant, violent, undemocratic, and illegal campaigns....

        "article": "Delhi is poised for a head-on clash between chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi with BJP shying from naming a CM face. After a series of electoral reverses for its incumbent state governments, BJP has the opportunity to take advantage of anti-incumbency, if it exists. But AAP can boast of improvements in public infrastructure, with no corruption taint on its record. However, AAP’s job will be made harder by Congress, competing for similar voter segments.Delhi’s assembly elections are unique for several reasons. It packs in over two crore residents, a population larger than nearly 150 countries. Delhi is almost entirely urban, presenting challenges of air quality, last-mile transportation, women’s safety, piped water supply, solid waste disposal, etc. It presents a far cry from other state elections where rural voters hold the key and farm issues or caste politics dominate. This could be one reason that a young political movement like AAP could suddenly emerge and talk alternative politics. Nevertheless, the euphoria over AAP was quick to subside and its government, without control over police, has appeared powerless on several occasions.But there is no denying that CMs of Delhi like Kejriwal and Sheila Dikshit have enjoyed a disproportionate presence in the national consciousness. Consequently, BJP will eye a comeback in Delhi after two decades as a fitting counter to the spreading anti-CAA-NRC protests. However, BJP will have to weigh carefully the utility of anchoring its campaign around nationalism. If Delhi’s voters are in the mood to talk about local issues like Jharkhand recently, the strategy could backfire. Kejriwal himself has learnt a lesson on this front and refrained from frontal attacks against PM Modi on national issues.Even on the anti-CAA protests or JNU violence Kejriwal hasn’t taken muscular positions, calculating that he shouldn’t fall into BJP’s trap of making the elections a vote on PM Modi or nationalism. Conversely, Modi would be hard-pressed to talk about local issues with the felicity that Kejriwal can muster in tom-tomming his doorstep delivery of rations, power subsidies, mohalla clinics and free bus transport for women. Congress’s improved performance in the LS polls raises the prospect of anti-BJP votes splitting, an outcome AAP will fear. The divided opposition is BJP’s best hope, as regional parties have proven in recent times that national heft isn’t a reliable guide to assembly results.415 days ago Both national parties would gain from the presence of capable, charismatic regional leaders. Smt Sheila Dixit served as CM of Delhi for three terms, visibly improved Delhi. Five years ago, Ms Kiran Bedi was declared as the CM candidate.
