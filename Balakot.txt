        "date": "August 21, 2019, 8:06 PM  IST",
        "article": "In another big indictment of the quality of the fighter squadrons with the air force, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa has said that his MiG-21s are so old that no one even drives cars of that vintage. The air force chief’s assessment reflects a suboptimal level of war preparedness. There is a severe shortage of fighter squadrons that needs to be remedied immediately if India is to meet its varied security challenges. The IAF is down to just 30 fighter squadrons which in a few years will be whittled further to 26. In comparison much smaller Pakistan will have 25 fighter squadrons by 2021.This hardware deficit was brought home during the post Balakot air skirmishes with Pakistan earlier this year when ageing MiG-21 Bisons were deployed against Pakistani F-16s. It was in those skirmishes that Wing Commander Abhinandan’s MiG was shot down by Pakistani forces after he himself downed a Pakistani F-16. If these conditions persist, victory in war will only come at huge costs. The IAF’s hardware woes are due to a combination of ageing aircraft, tardy pace of indigenisation and slow induction of foreign imports. Even the 36 Rafale jets being bought from France are yet to see delivery.So acute is the situation that IAF earlier this year was looking to acquire 21 MiG-29 jets lying in a mothballed condition in Russia since the 1980s. And all this ‘jugaad’ is at a time when other forces are looking to fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. Understandably, the budget for weapons modernisation is tight. But funds can be freed up by pursuing greater integration within the forces and creating joint theatre commands. And to move along this tri-service architecture it is imperative that the post of chief of defence staff is inaugurated forthwith.554 days ago Will the Defence Secretary,I.A.S, be held accountable and responsible for this sorry state of Force Levels of the I.A.F. ? After all, according to the Rules of Business at the Centre, the Defence Secretary is charged with \" the responsibility of Defending India \". Not the Service Chiefs. Until and unless the present edifice of the Ministry of Defence is razed to the ground, and a new structure with a healthy mix of the Service element included in the decision making apparatus, your paper will be writing a similar Editorial a few years later. It's an unprofessional Ministry of Defence, that India is vested with at the moment. Shameful, to say the very least. Jai Ho...

        "date": "June 4, 2019, 1:26 PM  IST",
        "article": "Many had expected Ajit Doval to be reappointed as the National Security Advisor in the Modi 2.0 regime. This time around, he has also been elevated to the rank of cabinet minister. The NSA position was innovated by the Vajpayee government, then continued by the Manmohan and Modi governments. But Doval is the first NSA to have cabinet rank.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-122069\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ajit-Doval-1-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ajit-Doval-1-300x184.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ajit-Doval-1-52x32.jpg 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ajit-Doval-1.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\">Just like the appointment of former foreign secretary S Jaishankar as foreign minister, what is being signalled is the prime minister’s trust and his priorities. For example, a significant amount of credit for the success of the post-Uri surgical strikes in PoK, as well as the Balakot strikes post-Pulwama may go to Doval. In resolving the Doklam standoff, both Doval and Jaishankar reportedly played key roles.Also read: NSA Ajit Doval gets 5 more years, and cabinet rank as wellGiven that their appointment has sparked discussion of a centralized security architecture built around the Modi-Jaishankar-Doval trinity, it is worth underlining that on the defence reforms side there has been much talk but less progress on the creation of a chief of defence staff, to set aside turf wars and operationalize a combined tri-service theatre — as is the case with modern armed forces elsewhere in the world. This, in fact, was a primary recommendation of the Kargil review committee, yet to see the light of day. It is to be hoped that the freshly re-elected government will deliver this reform instead of letting certain sections of the armed forces and bureaucracy continue to run it aground. This too is a security imperative.633 days ago Modi again proves that he respects the performers,no matter whether they do not belong to political class.What matters is the nations security,safety and well being.This also proves that irrespective of seniority or proximity, he gives importance to performers....

        "headline": "Tense Kashmir: Centre must scotch rumours following unprecedented withdrawal of Amarnath pilgrims and tourists",
        "date": "August 4, 2019, 7:54 PM  IST",
        "article": "A tense situation descended on Kashmir over the weekend as the annual Amarnath yatra was called off almost two weeks ahead of schedule, with security forces uncovering a terror plot. Arguably, only a BJP government could have pulled off the unprecedented curtailment of the Amarnath yatra – if it had been a non-BJP government, the narrative would have been that it is thwarting a Hindu pilgrimage at the behest of terrorists. Valid questions are being raised about whether the security advisory issued by the J&K government, asking tourists and pilgrims to leave the Valley immediately, was really necessary.Nevertheless, there is a genuine sense within the security establishment that the unprecedented precautions are called for as a major Pakistan-backed terror attack is impending. Seven Pakistani infiltrators have been shot in a bid to enter the Valley. Terrorists from groups like JeM and Hizbul have also been intercepted in separate encounters, and arms recovered from them include devices with Pakistani markings and a US M-24 sniper rifle, suggesting a Pakistani hand. There is heavy firing from across the LoC, to which Indian forces are retaliating.The Amarnath yatra has been attacked by terrorists several times before. If another such attack happens in the present context, after Balakot, and evidence is found of a Pakistani hand, it would amount to a serious provocation and lead to a warlike situation. However, President Donald Trump’s offers to “mediate” on Kashmir may have put the Pakistani establishment in an adventurist mood. It could calculate that any international blowback to terror operations in Kashmir can be countered by threatening to withhold cooperation from US troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. In view of this fraught situation, a case can perhaps be made for extreme security precautions.However, the pulling out of outsiders together with a massive mobilisation of security forces is creating uncertainty and fear in the state. Understandably, it is making people speculate that something big is underway in J&K, and that the Centre is planning to abrogate Article 35A as well as Article 370, which give the state special powers of autonomy. But one reason not to do anything like this now is precisely the fraught situation in the state. The Centre must instead issue a clarification, at a sufficiently senior level to carry credibility, that nothing of this sort is planned.571 days ago Today the serious, blunder mistake of the Former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru will be rectified/corrected, today BJP's Central Government is going to bring a permanent solution to the Kashmir's lingering on the problem, which will leave all Kashmir's Anti-India Leaders speechless. BJP's Central Government will isolate Jammu by making it an independent State, Kashmir & Ladakh will come under the Central Rule as Union Territory, meaning Kashmir and Ladakh will have no political party, with this temporary Article Section 370 and illegal Article 35 (a) will automatically seize to exist on its own,suppose in case if there is any protest by any political parties they might go to the Supreme Court, where the case will be dismissed in the interest of the country and Kashmir will start heading on the path of the development &  prosperity, terrorism will end, permanent peace will prevail ....

        "date": "March 29, 2019, 7:59 PM  IST",
        "article": "In a move to turn the heat on China for repeatedly blocking the listing of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed chief Masood Azhar as a terrorist, the US has sought a discussion on the matter in the UN Security Council. This will force China to make public its reasons for stalling efforts to designate Azhar – Beijing has put a technical hold on the matter four times. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has forcefully articulated what New Delhi is afraid to say: While China thinks nothing of detaining and abusing a million Muslims at home, it also extends its umbrella of protection for violent Islamist terrorists abroad, such as Masood Azhar – amounting to “shameful hypocrisy”.But while the US move to put pressure on China is welcome, New Delhi can’t expect Washington to do all the heavy lifting. It must step up to the plate and find ways to pressure China on its own. If it’s claimed the Balakot strike exemplified a break with the past and emergence of a new, bold India determined to strike out in its own interests, then the same approach must apply to China. New Delhi must stop being diffident and squarely confront Beijing over aiding Pakistani terrorism.If New Delhi can overcome its psychological trauma of defeat in the long-ago 1962 war, there is no dearth of ways it can get back at Beijing. Ramping up ties with Taiwan, speaking out against injustices heaped on Uighurs, renewing support to the Tibetan government-in-exile, ratcheting up Quad activities, raising barriers to Chinese imports and barring China’s Huawei from participating in 5G trials on security grounds – a concern that’s been raised globally – should all raise the costs for Beijing.

He has blamed the BJP government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for whipping up anti-Pakistan sentiment in India only to win another term in the upcoming parliamentary elections.Imran’s allegations are not only egregiously mendacious but also show that Pakistan is nervous about the rising cost of perpetrating cross-border terrorism in India. <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-118756\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Imran-Khan-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Imran-Khan-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Imran-Khan-52x39.jpg 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Imran-Khan.jpg 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">To begin with, Pakistan has been an aggressor against India ever since the first war in 1947.

The terror attack plotted in Pakistan necessitated India’s air strikes on Jaish’s Balakot terror camp.However, Imran instead of asking his country to introspect about the damages incurred by Pakistan’s terror policy, blatantly lied that Pulwama attack was homegrown and Jaish-e-Mohammad has no links with Pakistan.This is nothing but the denial that Pakistani society has been in for the last three decades. Pakistan PM can continue to perpetuate this deception to stay in power with the support of the Pakistani army and the ISI.

        "headline": "It’s politics, stupid: Economic woes will weigh on the voter but may not determine Lok Sabha election",
        "date": "April 9, 2019, 7:15 PM  IST",
        "article": "As India begins its countdown to the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, to be held tomorrow, BJP must be hoping that a version of the Bill Clinton dictum – “it’s the economy, stupid” – is not uppermost on voters’ minds. Farm incomes have stagnated and agrarian distress is widespread. In a nod to the seriousness of the jobs crisis BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said recently that the idea of creating 9-5 jobs is old fashioned and his party focusses instead on “livelihood opportunities”, which is suitably vague and amorphous. A leaked NSSO job survey has indicated the number of unemployed men went up by two crores in the five years upto 2017-18.It would be no exaggeration to say that India is currently experiencing the dark side of its much touted demographic “dividend”. But two factors will help BJP. One, it’s not as if its opponents have any compelling economic propositions. Two, Indian elections are not determined by economics alone. Alliances are equally important. Here, BJP has smartly stitched up its own alliances – including with the recalcitrant Shiv Sena – while Congress has dithered, perhaps thrown off balance by BJP’s heated campaign rhetoric on unwieldy mahagathbandhans.Moreover, no other party comes close to BJP’s ground game, organisational and financial strength – all amounting to a formidable political machine. For example, in the last financial year BJP alone has garnered 95% of the political donations through the flawed electoral bond scheme – which the Election Commission ought to have disallowed due to its opacity and whose legality is up for a hearing before the Supreme Court today. Add to that, BJP’s Brahmastra is perhaps Prime Minister Narendra Modi – for whose energy, oratorical skills, charisma and personal popularity the opposition has no real matching figure. The recent Balakot strike would also have contributed to Modi’s popularity.BJP is playing to its strength by crafting a presidential-style campaign around Modi. Seemingly Congress, too, has been playing to BJP’s strengths by attacking it on grounds of national security, as well as alleged corruption on the Rafale deal – whose intricacies are too complex for most Indians to follow – when it ought to have been laser-focussed on the government’s economic failures. Somewhat belatedly, it has sought to switch the focus back to the economy by proposing the ham-handed NYAY income support scheme. All these factors contribute towards making NDA the alliance to beat this election, even if a hung parliament is a possible outcome.688 days ago The BJP inherited a disastrous economy but it managed to turn that around. That is a huge achievement. Why not acknowledge that first? The agrarian problems are not new to India. What you need to note is what all got done in just 5 years. The NSSO unemployment numbers make no sense because there has been no uniform or systematic metric that has been used over the decades. You should instead count how many ways of livelihood have been created in the last five years. These numbers are huge! So stop misguiding people. The beneficiaries of the various schemes of the BJP government are experiencing the benefits. They know and will vote for BJP.

        "date": "April 11, 2019, 8:10 PM  IST",
        "article": "India’s festival of democracy – the Lok Sabha elections – kicked off with 91 seats spanning 20 states going to the polls yesterday in the first of seven phases. The stakes are high, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bengal, Bihar and Odisha which will see voting in multiple phases. Western UP – a crucial hunting ground for BJP – has remained a puzzle in this election with SP, BSP and RLD uniting to project a strong opposition while Congress could play spoiler, especially in seats that BSP is contesting.The woes of sugarcane farmers and the destruction of the cattle economy had put BJP on the backfoot. But the region’s infamous communal cleavages, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s larger than life image, and BJP’s ability to mobilise youth and non-Jatav, non-Yadav castes could also play into determining the outcome of 2019. Seven of 10 seats in the drought-prone Vidarbha region – home to BJP’s two Maharashtra heavyweights, Nitin Gadkari and Devendra Fadnavis – polled yesterday and rallies here saw Modi and Rahul Gandhi loudly pitch the virtues of their respective PM-Kisan and NYAY schemes to reach out to farmers.In southern Odisha, once a Congress stronghold, BJP had pressed its top guns including Modi and Amit Shah into the first phase campaign for four seats in a determined bid to build momentum before the next phases on April 18, 23 and 29. The strategy was no different for Bengal’s Cooch Behar and Alipurduar where BJP strongly fancies its chances, forcing chief minister Mamata Banerjee to camp in the area for four days. The north-east will be keenly watched this time as BJP and its NEDA partners have ended Congress’s dominance in all seven states.Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, swept by BJP in 2014, saw the party aggressively pitch the Uri and Balakot strikes to stir voters, given the significant number of armed service personnel and retirees in these two hill states. The first phase saw sentiments like farm distress, caste, Pakistan, religion and anti-incumbency come to the fore, but BJP will be relieved at opposition’s failure to make unemployment their primary poll plank. Nevertheless, the turnout from the first few phases will tell whether 2019 is another wave election like 2014.686 days ago There are indications that Jats, Jatav Dalits and Muslims are coming together seamlessly in western UP. The Congress partyâ  s somewhat clumsy intervention will hurt both formations, but not significantly. The MGB should get at least 45 seats. 2. Tweets from journalists I trust suggest Vidarbha is sullen, resentful. Minister Nitin Gadkari is working hard to retain his seat. 3. CM Naveen Patnaik has fixed the roof that had begun to leak a little after the Zilla Parishad results. CM Mamata Banerjee in neighbouring Bengal is even more solidly placed. The two of them, along with CM KCR and young Jagan from Andhra will be a powerful bloc, inclined more towards UPA than NDA, on their terms. 4. A somewhat humbled, chastened Congress will hitch a ride on the tailwind the regional parties are generating.

        "headline": "Rafale, Bofors: Current defence procurement procedures are jeopardising national security",
        "date": "March 7, 2019, 7:37 PM  IST",
        "article": "After India’s surgical strike on a Jaish-e-Muhammed terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, the conversation over the Rafale fighter jet deal has moved from questioning the deal itself to the urgent need for such modern aircraft. The aerial dogfight that ensued when the Pakistani air force decided to respond to Balakot saw the Indian air force’s ageing MiG-21 Bisons go up against Pakistan’s F-16s. This disparity in air power quality is unacceptable if India is to pursue a new security paradigm where it reserves the right to undertake pre-emptive strikes against Pakistan-based terror targets.Yet, India’s defence procurement policy leaves a lot to be desired. In some ways Rafale is reminiscent of the previous acquisition of Bofors field guns which was tainted by a scam, but nevertheless the key question moved quickly from why Bofors guns to why there was so much delay in acquiring them when they proved instrumental to dislodging Pakistani intruders during the 1999 Kargil war. In case of Rafale the government has been unnecessarily evasive in answering some legitimate questions, perhaps in a misguided attempt to head off controversy in a manner which has only elicited more controversy.The Supreme Court has, for example, rightly questioned the government when the latter argued, somewhat late in the day, that Rafale documents published by a newspaper were “stolen” from the defence ministry and hence shouldn’t be taken on record. Earlier, the government had to seek a correction in the SC judgment on a basic premise: that CAG had apparently already submitted its report on the Rafale deal to Parliament’s PAC and the latter had examined the report, at a time when such a report was still in the works. Such slippages have caused SC to reopen the Rafale case.If the government wishes to argue it has been so proactive in acquiring Rafale that it doesn’t have time to answer questions, that too doesn’t stand: it won’t get even a single Rafale delivered by the end of its tenure. From Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s perspective, he may be using Rafale as a weapon to neutralise Bofors corruption charges. This strategy won’t get much traction either given the urgent necessity of acquiring advanced fighter jets. While defence acquisition in India remains mired in political controversies, there are reports that Pakistan is collaborating with China to develop a fifth-generation fighter. If India’s post-Balakot strategy is to succeed it must urgently work out a quick, clean, transparent and efficient mode of defence acquisition.721 days ago 1. I am in full agreement with views expressed in this editorial. Citizen-voters should know full details about Rafale aircraftsâ   deal. But let us not forget that   Rafale aircraftsâ   deal is just one instance of alleged corruption in defence equipment procurement deals. 2. We know that all these years defence deals have been a source of funds for the party & politicians in power in the Centre. Therefore, my question in this regard is very simple: Do Congress & other opposition parties wish that corruption in all fields, including defence deals, be curbed? Or they just wish to be in power by making allegations of corruption and win over gullible voters? 3. Congress President Shri Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly made serious allegations against NDA government and in particular against PM Shri Narendra Modi as regards Rafale aircrafts deal. Citizens like me are not sure that the Congress President is really against corruption. Citizens think that (a) Shri Rahul Gandhi wishes to make use of allegations of corruption to seize power and (b) he is not at all serious about curbing corruption in defence deals or about curbing use of black money in elections. 4. Citizens wish that Shri Rahul Gandhi should make a public announcement about what the Congress led UPA government would do about Rafale deal assuming that UPA is voted to power after 2019 Lok Sabha election. Citizens wish to know this: would the Rafale deal be renegotiated, would it be cancelled, would those who are responsible in NDA government be tried for misuse of power? These questions are in citizensâ   mind and the need a straight forward answer. Would Congress president give answers in national interest?  Let us how he responds to questions from citizens like me. 5. Incidentally, I am curious to know how many lawyers and journalists who claim to have exposed corruption in Rafale deal are really concerned about curbing corruption in defence equipment procurement and how many dislike Narendra Modi (NaMo) and wish to use Rafale deal solely to defeat NaMo?...

        "date": "March 12, 2019, 7:34 PM  IST",
        "article": "Officially sounding the poll bugle, Congress’s highest decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), met in Gujarat’s Ahmedabad to finalise strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha campaign. The choice of venue was interesting. CWC was meeting in Gujarat after 58 years and the optical suggestion was of raiding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own den. Further, CWC resolved to “defeat the RSS/BJP ideology of fascism, hatred, anger and divisiveness” and affirmed that no sacrifice was too great in this endeavour.This is a bold statement but the way Congress has been approaching the poll battle is somewhat listless. Its narrative of saving India’s institutions from BJP’s authoritarian ways lacks convincing detail. Its highlighting of issues such as joblessness, agrarian distress and communal strife has been piecemeal. Instead of marketing an alternative positive vision, it appears content with simply criticising the failings of the Modi government. BJP, meanwhile, has hit the ground running. Realising it could face much anti-incumbency in the upcoming polls, it has quickly adjusted its position vis-à-vis allies and completed seat-sharing arrangements in important states like Bihar and Maharashtra by displaying flexibility.Plus, after the Balakot surgical strike, it’s once again looking to cash in on its nationalist narrative with the PM being projected as the only leader who can keep India safe. In order to overcome the BJP electoral juggernaut Congress really needs to build smart alliances. It has been dragging its feet here, caught between a desire to rebuild the party long-term in crucial states such as UP and putting together winning combinations for the polls around the corner. But, except in states where it is basically in a one on one contest with BJP, Congress has no choice but to yield to potential alliance partners, and even play second fiddle, if it’s to mount a serious challenge come April.AAP in Delhi wanted an alliance but Congress’s state unit has been resisting. In UP, it has failed to sweeten a way aboard the SP-BSP alliance. On tying up with the Left, it is still struggling to resolve the opposing imperatives of Bengal and Kerala. And in Karnataka, Congress and JD(S) are still undecided over the seat split given old local rivalries.

        "article": "China has ambitions of becoming the pre-eminent geopolitical power. Such a role calls for big contributions to global common goods, such as taking on terrorism and enhancing regional security. But in its role as Pakistan’s strategic patron, China fails miserably at this task. Far from reining in the Pakistan mosque-mujahideen-military complex there’s a Red Wall of protection going up around it. At the UN China has now blocked a proposal to ban Jaish-e-Muhammed chief Masood Azhar for the fourth time. This is an abhorrent response to the deadliest terror attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir, for which JeM claimed responsibility.In responding to the Pulwama attack with an air strike against the JeM terror training camp at Balakot, India broke free of its self-imposed shackles in the proxy war that Pakistan has been waging against it for decades. But China’s actions at the UNSC – having Pakistan’s back even when it’s being pressed by most world capitals to roll up its state sponsorship of terrorism – reveal it to be the elephant in the room that New Delhi must now wake up to.Beijing follows a curious double standard in dealing with New Delhi – while it expects the latter to treat its red lines on what it defines as its core interests with great deference, it also stomps all over India’s core interests. It appears more apprehensive about how JeM may react to any ban placed on its leader, than to how New Delhi may respond to being consistently spurned. It is this calculus that New Delhi must seek to change if the NDA government’s claims of ushering in a ‘new India’, that has snapped out of its perennially defensive approach, have any substance.Thus, New Delhi can stop being overly cautious about China’s sensitivities from Taiwan and Tibet to Xinjiang. India should respect a one-China policy to the extent China respects a one-India policy. China makes light of the plentiful evidence against the JeM chief, India should highlight extensively documented human rights abuses against Uighurs. There is plenty of scope to squeeze Chinese business – without fear of retaliation since Indian business has already been squeezed out of China, yielding a yawning trade deficit of $63 billion (this figure has gone up by about 75% on NDA’s watch). It is now time to break out of another self-imposed taboo: India’s traditionally deferential policy towards China.713 days ago China needs to be hit where it hurts them most - their trade.

        "article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a significant political statement by leaving out Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan from the list of guests invited for his second term swearing-in ceremony.Five years ago, when Modi romped to victory, he had made a reconciliatory gesture towards Pakistan by inviting the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, even as he had been voted to power on a poll campaign promise that his government would be tough with Pakistan. However, after a series of ISI-backed terror attacks, beginning in Gurdaspur and Pathankot, which were followed by post-Burhan Wani violence and Uri, Pakistan left no room for the Modi government to engage Islamabad through diplomacy and dialogue.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-121721\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File-52x39.jpg 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PM-Modi-TNN-File.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">Reaching out to Pakistan appears to be misinterpreted. The Pulwama suicide bombing on Fenruary 14, owned by Pakistan based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad, precipitated another major crisis and brought the two hostile neighbors to the brink of war. Modi’s decision to retaliate against the terror attack with air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camps within Pakistani territory in Balakot, led to a paradigm shift in the Indian response. Since then, Prime Minister Imran Khan has been making peace overtures in vain.Modi has returned to power in recent parliamentary elections with a bigger mandate than the last time, and has no incentive to reciprocate Khan’s rhetoric. After Balakot the Modi government has managed with the help of the US, UK and France to pressurize China to unblock its move at the UN to designate Jaish chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. This has also coincided with Pakistan’s deep economic crisis and a bailout from the IMF.At this point, New Delhi should gauge through backchannel contacts whether Islamabad (and even more importantly, Rawalpindi) have anything concrete on offer. Fuller engagement must await a tangible change in Islamabad’s use of the terror tool.Read also: Neighbouring leaders invited for Narendra Modi swearing-in, Imran left out640 days ago Good decision by Modi, isolate Pak in each and every platform.

        "headline": "TsuNamo again: BJP landslide indicates some deep structural shifts in Indian politics",
        "date": "May 24, 2019, 12:00 AM  IST",
        "article": "If the 2014 Lok Sabha elections were marked by anti-incumbency, pro-incumbency was the keynote of the 2019 elections as BJP decimated the opposition. The BJP juggernaut rolled across its bastions in the north and west of the country – in bellwether state UP its voteshare shot up from 42.6% in 2014 to 49.5%, negating the impact of SP, BSP and RLD joining hands – while making significant incursions into the south (Karnataka, Telangana) and east (Bengal, Odisha). At last count BJP had wins/leads in 303 seats and its allies in 48 seats, giving NDA a thumping majority in the Lok Sabha.What accounts for the shift from anti-incumbency in 2014 to pro-incumbency in 2019? It’s not as if the economy has changed much. On the positive side inflation was managed well during NDA’s first term (but faces upward pressure now). On the negative side joblessness appears to have grown more acute. One could attribute BJP’s success to better administration of welfare schemes, the Balakot strikes which retaliated against Pakistan’s sponsorship of terror groups, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal popularity. But while all these factors may have played a role they do not, even in combination, satisfactorily account for the magnitude of BJP’s sweeping victory.It’s possible some deep structural shifts are taking place in the Indian polity. The so-called “secular” model many other parties have followed is to work with conservative Muslim clerics to secure the Muslim vote, and then add on specific castes as each party’s USP, relying on post-Mandal social engineering. Thus SP is the party of Yadavs, BSP of Jatavs and so on. This model, however, offers plenty of opportunity for countermobilisation. BJP has moved into this vacuum swiftly and effectively. It may have capitalised, for example, on the unseen backlash to aggressive expansion of caste reservations, cementing its support among upper castes with the EWS quota. Hindu upper castes would comprise a solid bloc that can neutralise the Muslim vote (which, in any case, is split among several parties). Alongside, Modi also projects a different kind of backward caste identity that’s fluid, aspirational, upwardly mobile and less dependent on specific caste networks. As smartphones spread and cities expand, this style may appeal more to Hindu lower castes.BJP alone has around 300 Lok Sabha seats which gives it the power to override even its allies in the next government. With great power, however, must come great responsibility. The Indian polity is dynamic and the voter can never be taken for granted. Now that BJP has acquired enough confidence in government it must utilise the first hundred days of its second tenure to launch the transformative leap that the economy badly needs – more so since global headwinds are growing – even as it fully respects constitutional values in letter and in spirit. BJP started on the right, reformist note in 2014 but veered off track following Congress accusations of it being anti-poor, lurching later into radical socialist experiments such as demonetisation.“Factor” markets of land, labour and capital need market-oriented reform for efficient allocation of resources; so do agriculture and education. At the same time, the state must step in and provide quality inputs where the market cannot provide these (such as healthcare, basic education). Unproductive subsidies must be cut, and the autonomy of public institutions respected and expanded. Such reforms, whose objective is to ramp up India’s global competitiveness, may be painful at the beginning. But BJP has the mandate and trust of the people, and must be bold enough to push them through. A powerhouse economy and its spinoff benefits will, in turn, yield a political bonanza for BJP by the time the next general election come round in 2024. 644 days ago It is clear that public had realised that caste,gatbandhans, will not deliver anything except internal fights as evident in Karnataka.Public had understood only a stable majority govt can deliver.It is more than abundantly clear when you see results of A.P.,telengana,Orissa etc.They have given absolute majority well above half way mark in all cases.

        "date": "April 28, 2019, 7:55 PM  IST",
        "article": "The fourth phase of the Lok Sabha elections covering 71 constituencies in nine states takes the electoral battle for 2019 into areas were BJP had performed exceedingly well in 2014. NDA had won a whopping 56 of these 71 seats, a near 80% strike rate, and BJP’s challenge now is to ensure that anti-incumbency does not take a toll. This phase will see 17 seats in Maharashtra, 13 in Rajasthan, 13 in Uttar Pradesh, eight in Bengal and some more seats in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand go to the polls.BJP-Shiv Sena had swept all 17 seats in 2014 in this phase in the Mumbai, Konkan and north Maharashtra regions. The Modi wave and double anti-incumbency against the two-term UPA and three-term Congress-NCP governments at the Centre and state had combined with deadly effect in 2014. Despite beating the Congress-NCP combine in finalising seat sharing, NDA’s first mover advantage was negated by the multi-phased polling. Mumbai’s grouse about crumbling infrastructure, the unending farm crisis and recurring drought in rural areas, Raj Thackeray’s well attended rallies and his direct attack on PM Modi’s achievements could become turning points in this election.Rajasthan’s 13 seats, all bagged by BJP in 2014, are barometers for how the Balakot strike will play out as an election issue in the Hindi heartland. National security plays an important part in the border state’s popular discourse and Modi’s muscular approach to Pakistan appeals to many voters. Congress, back in power in December, is highlighting its welfare measures like reviving MGNREGA and promising NYAY but farmers are upset about farm loan waiver delays. Interestingly, developmental issues like jobs and drought are getting sidetracked by the security-welfare refrain of the two parties.Of the 13 seats in UP in the Awadh and Bundelkhand regions, BJP had won 12 in 2014. Congress is a strong player in seats like Kanpur, Unnao, Farrukhabad and Jhansi and a triangular fight could cut into SP-BSP’s votes. MP, like Rajasthan, has witnessed a Congress revival forcing BJP to fall back on RSS in deciding ticket distribution. In a ‘wave-less’ election, caste consolidation and reverse consolidation are being hotly discussed in the Hindi heartland. Not surprisingly, Modi is aggressively playing the caste card in UP.

        "article": "In a diplomatic victory for India, China finally vacated its technical hold on the listing of Jaish-e-Muhammed chief Masood Azhar at the UN Security Council’s 1267 sanctions committee. This clears the way for Azhar’s designation as a global terrorist, attracting travel restrictions, assets freeze and arms embargo. This was an open and shut case. When Jaish itself was a UN designated terrorist organisation, proscribing its chief was a no-brainer. The only question is why China took so long.The utility of Azhar’s listing must be seen in the right perspective. The other big Pakistani terrorist, Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, has been on the sanctions list for quite some time now. But it has made little difference to his ability to move around in Pakistan. He has even expressed ambitions to join Pakistani politics. Thus, Azhar’s listing is unlikely to turn off the Pakistani terror tap overnight. This is where India needs a bi-partisan, multi-pronged policy to persuade Pakistan to make a strategic shift towards peace with its neighbours. Within India, the binary of warmongers and peaceniks needs to end – both groups are wrong. There is no magic key – whether jhappi-pappi and jawboning or military strikes – that will persuade Pakistan’s establishment to change course tomorrow.The Narendra Modi government must be credited with having raised the costs for Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism. But New Delhi must put in place a long-term plan that combines hard military options like the Balakot strikes and relentless diplomatic pressure on all fronts, along with talks if Pakistan makes genuine concessions. Automatic, pre-planned military response should become the norm if a terror attack like Pulwama or 26/11 is found to originate from Pakistan. Alongside, New Delhi should keep impressing upon other nations that doing business in Pakistan is a lost cause as long as it gives primacy to jihadis.Azhar’s listing also shows that India must continue working with the West, losing our ‘non-aligned’ inhibitions and ‘pan-Asian’ proclivities. China, after all, is proving to be the pan-Asian hegemon even as it stiffs India continually – while the West increasingly sees things India’s way. Moreover, it would be radically disruptive of the global order and international peace if countries that covet neighbours’ territory are allowed to support terrorists and rattle nuclear sabres in order to support their claims, even as the non-proliferation order breaks down and more countries acquire nuclear weapons (witness North Korea).664 days ago For decades we were told that Kashmir became a mess and a disputed territory because Jawaharlal Nehru sought help from UN.

        "article": "With Election Commission’s announcement of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll schedule – which will stretch between April 11 and May 19 across seven phases – campaigning is expected to climax in the weeks ahead. Incumbent BJP is already firing on all cylinders, leaving no stone unturned to reach out to the people for another term. Meanwhile, the opposition is still putting together its electoral combinations through a process that can be best described as crossing the river by feeling the stones beneath. But one thing that appears to be certain is that 2019 is going to be quite different from 2014.Five years ago, UPA-2 was on its last legs while BJP was resurgent with Narendra Modi hitting all the right notes. BJP then had a certain newness that caught the imagination of the electorate. It was speaking the language of development and ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ while touting Modi as a strong leader who could take India to great heights. This saw even BJP’s extravagant jumlas such as Rs 15 lakh in every bank account from return of black money stashed abroad find traction in some quarters. The result was a Modi wave that reduced Congress to its lowest tally in the Lok Sabha.However, in 2019 most of BJP’s newness has worn off and the Lok Sabha polls are unlikely to be a wave election. Plus, some of Modi government’s policies like demonetisation have created doubts about BJP’s administrative acumen. Thus, there are two ways in which this election can go. First, BJP emerges as the single largest party on the strength of its money power, organisational superiority, Modi’s impact as an orator. Add to this the mileage that BJP is seeking to derive from the Balakot surgical strike, and the party is still in pole position.The second scenario is BJP facing considerable anti-incumbency due to agrarian distress and joblessness, giving opposition parties the edge. True, opposition parties don’t have a grand narrative like ‘acche din’ apart from a vague ‘save democracy’ plank. But they could still tap into grassroots grievances, taking on BJP in a state-by-state manner. If scepticism about promises made by various parties prevails, Indians will fall back upon old caste and community loyalties. In which case, we could see a return of strong identity politics giving the advantage to whichever alliance gets its caste and community combinations right.717 days ago These \"imaginations\" are nothing in front of the sensible voters of this great country.

        "date": "March 25, 2019, 8:01 PM  IST",
        "article": "After India signalled a change in its security red lines following the Balakot surgical strike against a Jaish-e-Muhammed terror training camp deep inside Pakistan, New Delhi now appears to be making another break with the past. It has flashed the deplorable case of two teenaged Hindu sisters who were abducted, forcibly converted to Islam and married to Muslim men in Pakistan’s Sindh. It all started with external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj highlighting the plight of the two girls on social media. This saw a response from Pakistan’s I&B minister Fawad Chaudhry that led to a heated exchange. The Indian government also sent an official note to the Pakistan foreign office, demanding suitable remedial action to protect minorities in that country.This is a new streak as India has traditionally struck a defensive stance on human rights issues. This has allowed countries like Pakistan to forcefully and repeatedly raise questions in international fora about India’s track record in protecting minority Muslims here, when the reality is that the situation is far worse for minorities (some would argue even the majority population) in countries like Pakistan and its all-weather friend China. In fact, what happened to the Sindh girls is shockingly quite common in Pakistan. Hindu and Sikh girls are frequently abducted and married to Muslim men with authorities looking the other way. And given the hold of Islamist forces in Pakistan, no political office is willing to take on such criminal practices.This was also exemplified by the recent murder of a university professor in Pakistan’s Punjab province by a student over blasphemy. The professor was reportedly planning a mixed gender event which the student found ‘un-Islamic’. Pakistan’s blasphemy laws have long provided cover for mob lynchings against liberals and minorities in that country.Against this backdrop, India shouldn’t hesitate in calling out Pakistan on its own human rights record. In fact, there’s also a case for doing the same with China. The latter’s treatment of Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists has been appalling. Moreover, China does India no favours in the international arena as exemplified by its repeated blocking of UN sanctions against Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar. Of course, human rights violations must be taken seriously whenever and wherever they occur. But if Pakistan and by extension China want to make this a political issue to target India, then New Delhi shouldn’t dither in showing them the mirror and asking for accountability.703 days ago While Muslims remain safest in India, minorities mostly in Pakistan and Bangladesh somewhat bear the brunt. India must exercise its right to raise legitimate concern on humanitarian issues because those people originally belonged to undivided India....

        "article": "India and Pakistan have agreed to observe a fresh ceasefire after a particularly violent 2020. Cross-border firing last year broke all records since the last 18 years, causing much distress to populations living along the LoC and the international border in Jammu & Kashmir. In fact, ceasefire violations from Pakistan had started spiking in 2019 after the Balakot surgical strike by India and New Delhi’s nullification of Article 370 vis-a-vis Kashmir. This trend continued in 2020 even as India was engaged in its tense border standoff with China.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-150885\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Capture-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"786\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Capture-2.jpg 786w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Capture-2-300x222.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Capture-2-768x569.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Capture-2-52x39.jpg 52w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\">This raised suspicions that Pakistan and China were coordinating their military activities against India. But a few weeks ago Pakistan army chief Qamar Bajwa started making peace overtures, stating that the two countries should resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully. And it is against this backdrop that the new commitment to the ceasefire must be seen. For, both Bajwa and PM Imran Khan have been at the receiving end of intense protests by the political opposition in Pakistan. And the ceasefire bid could be Bajwa’s and Imran’s ploy to temporarily change the narrative in Pakistan and relieve pressure against them.Read also: India, Pakistan agree to follow all ceasefire pactsIt could also be a signal to the new Joe Biden administration in the US that Pakistan is willing to reset ties with Washington. After all, a hands-free approach by the US pushes Pakistan more towards China. And Islamabad isn’t exactly comfortable becoming a Chinese vassal state.Read also: Ties thaw, but experts doubt ceasefire will lastThat said, from India’s point of view, any peace overtures from Pakistan have to be backed by concrete action against anti-India terror groups operating from Pakistani soil. As yet there is no indication that Pakistan is willing to give up terrorism as an instrument of state policy.Read also: US welcomes India-Pakistan joint statement on ceasefireThus, while the ceasefire commitment is welcome it remains to be seen if it will lead to a reduction in cross-border infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan. A wait-and-watch approach will be prudent for New Delhi.1 hour ago Pakistan cease fire agreement is nothing but diverting its attention from  the main issue  ..India must coordinate with china in order solve terrorist issue with pakistan..Every one is aware that pakistan is pawan under china .Indian anti terrorist cell should keep an eye over anti nationalist activist of pakistan...

        "headline": "Pulwama effect: National security could become BJP’s unique selling point in upcoming Lok Sabha polls",
        "date": "March 4, 2019, 7:52 PM  IST",
        "article": "It is apparent now that BJP is heading into the elections with the two surgical strikes on Pakistan as its USP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah, and the party apparatus at all levels have identified this as one thematic area where the opposition appears to flounder. On agriculture, jobs, welfare, industry, GDP and reforms there is really not much to choose from either side. All parties propose more or less the same mishmash of populist policies on the economic front, and demonetisation has been a bit of a misguided missile on BJP’s part. But on national security issues, Modi can tell voters that he avenged the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks.How could this play out as electoral strategy? The Kargil war fetched Vajpayee no gains in 1999 despite general election later that year. Many thought the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai would be a setback for UPA, but it did better in Lok Sabha elections next year than it did in 2004. India’s greatest military victory came in the 1971 war with Pakistan, but Congress lost heavily in the subsequent Lok Sabha elections held in 1977. Many argue that while national security issues may exercise the middle class in metropolitan cities, they make up a minuscule section of India’s vast electorate, most of whom struggle with bread and butter economic issues.Yet there are many counterarguments to this. With the advent of the smartphone and viral opinionated digital content, the reach of middle class opinion is greater than ever before. Moreover the Balakot strikes have come at a propitious time for BJP. With just a few weeks remaining to the Lok Sabha polls, this is likely to remain top of the mind for voters, especially with BJP election rhetoric making sure that they don’t forget.If this can swing even a small percentage of votes, the impact in terms of seats in a close, first-past-the-post election would significantly improve BJP’s chances. However, BJP could still meet with pushbacks if opposition parties unite to prevent division of their votes. This has already yielded impressive results in UP and Karnataka bypolls. BJP has also strengthened its alliances in Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu expecting such an eventuality. All told, the opposition could regain ground in the weeks ahead but its climb just got steeper.724 days ago Opposition has lost the narrative.It is unwise on its part to seek the \"evidence or proof\" of the strikes.This govt is claiming to have responded to a terror attack with surgical strikes.It is also asking Congress and other parties as to what THEY did when they were in power or what is THEIR response to repeated terror attacks.People/voters are not ready to accept that talks and dialogues with Pakistan can resolve this problem.Modi govt is claiming that it has found the solution.Opposition has to suggest something that is better than this.Seeking \"proof\" will not help....

        "headline": "Priyanka’s Debut: Congress can’t afford for her to be a part-time politician",
        "date": "March 13, 2019, 12:17 PM  IST",
        "article": "In her debut political speech, Priyanka Gandhi immediately struck a chord. The new Congress general secretary in charge of eastern UP sought to change the political narrative, bringing the focus back on bread and butter issues. She questioned the Narendra Modi government about its promises to create 2 crore jobs and deposit Rs 15 lakh in every Indian’s bank account. She further emphasised to the gathered crowd that their vote was a weapon that had to be exercised carefully without falling for irrelevant issues. She said that the main concerns during this election season were lack of jobs, women’s safety and farm distress.Clearly, Congress is trying to counter BJP’s nationalist pitch after the Balakot surgical strike. And using Priyanka, who proved herself to be articulate, composed and direct in her maiden speech, is a good strategy. In fact, given Priyanka’s persona she can bring a certain amount of balance to the Congress. Her brother and Congress president Rahul can go hard in his messaging while Priyanka can provide the soft foil.That said, it is unlikely that Priyanka can do much to impact Congress’s fortunes for this Lok Sabha election. However, she can be an effective long-term weapon for the party. However, for that she can’t be a part-time politician. She shouldn’t repeat the political trajectory of her brother. She must dive right in and engage with the party machinery and vote base full time. Only then will Congress benefit from her likeness to her grandmother Indira.716 days ago Remove her surname and her qualifications or achievement is big zero. I doubt if she can make any difference even with her full time efforts. Her husband is like monkey on her back which would cause more harm than anything good....
