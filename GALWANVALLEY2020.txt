        "headline": "Galwan Valley clash: Govt grants emergency financial powers to three services",
        "date": "Sunday, 21 June 2020",
        "article": "The government has granted the three services emergency financial powers of up to Rs 500 crore per procurement project to buy ammunition and weapons in view of the escalating border standoff with China, government sources said Sunday.The special financial powers have been given to the forces to procure weapons and military hardware at short notice to enhance their operational preparedness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), they said.The government has also relaxed certain rules to cut delays in military purchase like allowing the three services to procure required weapons and equipment from a single vendor, the sources said.Twenty Indian Army soldiers were killed in a violent clash in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley on June 15, triggering a massive escalation in tension between the two countries.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has already directed the Army, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force to enhance their operational readiness along the LAC, the 3,500 km de-facto border between India and China, amid fears of fresh confrontation.Military sources said the Army is going to use the emergency financial powers to expand its stock of ammunition as there is little possibility of any resolution of the standoff soon.\"The three services have been given emergency financial powers of up to Rs 500 crore per procurement project,\" said a source.The clash in Galwan Valley was the worst cross border confrontation between the two sides in 45 years. China's People's Liberation Army has not yet talked about the number of casualties it suffered.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control in Galwan.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when their troops clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas."

        "headline": "Jaishankar refutes RaGa claim, says soldiers were armed in Galwan valley",
        "date": "Friday, 19 June 2020",
        "article": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said all Indian troops guarding the border with China carried arms, refuting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s questions as to why Army personnel in Galwan Valley were sent “unarmed to martyrdom”.Jaishankar pointed out that armies of the two sides do not use firearms as per provisions of two bilateral agreements sealed in 1996 and 2005.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving the post. Those at Galwan on June 15 did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) is not to use firearms during face-offs,” Jaishankar said in a tweet.The latest incident may see the Government revisiting the standard operating procedure at the LAC, officials said.Earlier in a video message Rahul Gandhi condemned China’s actions in eastern Ladakh that resulted in the death of 20 soldiers. Pointing out that Indian soldiers were unarmed, Rahul sought to know who is responsible for this situation.“China committed a crime by killing India’s unarmed soldiers. I want to know who sent these unarmed soldiers in the harm’s way and why. Who is responsible,” said Rahul.The Congress party in a statement also asked whether the huge mistake in understanding the intention of China, not a symbol of the gross failure of the Central Government and their leadership.Experts are also asking why the Indian jawans were not asked to use firearms in self-defence when the Chinese assaulted them with such deadly weapons and the bloodshed continued for hours.Congress leader KC Venugopal and party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that today there is anguish in every mind. The entire country is suffering not only because of the inexplicable suffering that the Ranbankurs were shamelessly martyred, as well as the resentment as to why they were sent unarmed to meet China officials, they said.Army sources said that the Indian Army patrols are strictly prohibited from opening fire at the LAC and as a precaution, they do not carry guns. This confidence building agreement was inked between the two countries in 1996. It binds both the countries that neither side shall open fire or conduct blast operations within two km of the LAC.The 1996 agreement saw both the sides refraining from brandishing weapons at each other. The face-offs used to see pushing and jostling. The Chinese of late started pelting stones and now graduated to more lethal weapons like clubs with barbed wires and nails."

        "headline": "Chinese Army removing tents, seen withdrawing troops from Galwan Valley: Sources",
        "date": "Monday, 06 July 2020",
        "article": "In the first sign of de-escalation of tension in eastern Ladakh, the Chinese Army has removed tents and started to withdraw its troops from Galwan Valley as decided during high-level talks between the two militaries, government sources said on Monday.Galwan Valley was the site of a violent hand-to-hand clash between the two militaries on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.China's People's Liberation Army was seen removing tents and structures at patrolling point 14, the sources said, adding rearward movement of vehicles of Chinese troops was seen in the general area of Galwan and Gogra Hot Springs.They said disengagement of Chinese troops in the area has begun as per decisions arrived at during the Corps Commander-level talks.The sources said there was clear sign of withdrawal of structures and troops from the patrolling point 14 in Galwan Valley and that they are likely to move back more than a kilometre in the area.The sources said it would not be possible to know immediately how much distance the Chinese troops are going back and that there will be clarity only after a proper verification process is conducted.The clashes in Galwan Valley took place after Indian troops strongly opposed the erection of a surveillance post by the Chinese side near patrolling point 14.It is not immediately known whether the de-escalation initiative has also been started in the Pangong Tso area where the Chinese side has significantly enhanced its presence, particularly in areas between Finger 4 and Finger 8.On June 30, the Indian and Chinese armies held the third round of Lt General-level talks during which both sides agreed on an \"expeditious, phased and step wise\" de-escalation as a \"priority\" to end the standoff.The first round of the Lt General talks were held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley.However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Ladakh during which he said the era of expansionism is over and that the history is proof that \"expansionists\" have either lost or perished, in comments which were seen as a clear message to China that India is not going to backoff and would deal with the situation with a firm hand.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks.The tension escalated manifold after killing of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension.Following the Galwan Valley clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border besides moving in heavy weapons."

The Indian side has never undertaken any actions across the LAC. In fact, they have been patrolling this area for a long time without any incident,\" he said.Srivastava said the Chinese side attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the western sector of the India-China border areas since mid-May.\"These attempts were invariably met with an appropriate response from us,\" he said.Srivastava said India expects that Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the foreign ministers of two countries recently to ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas."

        "article": "India on Wednesday took strong exception to China claiming sovereignty over the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, saying its \"exaggerated and untenable claims\" are contrary to the understanding reached on the issue between the two sides.Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava's response came after China claimed that the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh is a part of its territory.\"As we have conveyed earlier today, External Affairs Minister and the State Councillor and Foreign Minister of China had a phone conversation on recent developments in Ladakh,\" Srivastava said late Wednesday night.\"Both sides have agreed that the overall situation should be handled in a responsible manner and that the understandings reached between Senior Commanders on 6th June should be implemented sincerely. Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,\" he said.Earlier on Wednesday, India delivered a strong message to China that the \"unprecedented\" incident in the Galwan Valley will have a \"serious impact\" on the bilateral relationship and held the \"pre-meditated\" action by Chinese army directly responsible for the violence that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.In a telephonic conversation, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar conveyed to his Chinese counterpart Wang Wi India's protest in the \"strongest terms\" and said the Chinese side should reassess its actions and take corrective steps, the Ministry of External Affairs said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the two sides agreed to \"cool down the situation on the ground as soon as possible\", and maintain peace and tranquillity in the border area in accordance with the agreement reached so far between the two countries.The clash in Galwan Valley on Monday night is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La in 1967 when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.Prior to the clashes, both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas."
