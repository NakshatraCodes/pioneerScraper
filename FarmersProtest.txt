        "article": "In a boost for Congress in Punjab, the party won seven out of the eight municipal corporations in civic polls, while emerging as the leader in the remaining Moga corporation. In fact, Congress’s victory particularly in Pathankot, Hoshiarpur and Bathinda – Bathinda will get a Congress mayor for the first time in 53 years – is a big blow for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP that were perceived to be strong in these areas. The polls likely reflect Punjab’s prevailing farm sentiment and attitude towards the Centre’s three new farm laws, with thousands of Punjabi farmers continuing to protest against them at Delhi’s borders.Plus, the split between SAD and BJP has clearly hurt both parties. While BJP won just 50 wards – down from 248 in 2015 – SAD won 281 fewer than the 870 wards it won last time. Even AAP, which was making its debut in the municipal polls, managed to win only 60 wards. With Punjab slated to go for assembly polls next year, the municipal results bolster the position of chief minister Amarinder Singh. The latter was quick to pass state bills negating the Centre’s farm laws, clearly signalling where he and Congress stood on the issue. Though the farm laws will take agriculture forward, Punjab local polls show those benefits haven’t been adequately or effectively communicated to people.Regarding assembly elections, Amarinder in 2017 had said it was his last election. But he walked back those comments last year, indicating his desire to contest in 2022. True, he remains Punjab Congress’s tallest leader. But younger leaders like Partap Singh Bajwa and Navjot Sidhu are getting restless for a spot in the limelight. The party, however, fears splits if it promotes a younger face. The civic poll’s outcome certainly boosts Amarinder’s case to head Congress in upcoming assembly elections.7 days ago congress should not feel elated winning civic election.

Undoing the misconceptions among farmers of the MSP regime’s impending demise is the primary task before various governments, and the Centre above all. Indeed outreach at the highest levels of Union government could be a game changer.

Hopes of doubling farm incomes rest on the success of these fledgling reforms and other advances like direct benefit transfer, cold chain networks and crop diversification schemes. Most farmers, of whom 86% fall in the small and marginal category, aren’t benefiting from MSPs, which has prompted the Centre to tackle cartelisation in mandis and ease private and corporate trade in the hope that more buyers at farmgate will translate to better prices.But the agitations in Punjab and Haryana, which boast of entrenched public procurement of crops, have been a speedbreaker. Ironically, paddy procurement in Punjab has topped last year’s numbers by a whopping 20%. This should allay fears of immediate MSP rollback. But in the long run the paddy MSP regime in these areas is unsustainable, not least because of depleting groundwater levels and rising air pollution. A phased, orderly transition through farm reforms and income support offers a win-win for farmers and traders. It would also correct harmful distortions in India’s food market. Absent these changes, a fragile ecological balance and intergenerational equity are gravely at risk. Centre and state governments must work together to handhold farmers through this big shift, which can prove just as momentous and fruitful as the Green Revolution.90 days ago Yes, leadership needed - also from the media.

        "article": "On Friday, the heart of Delhi was overwhelmed by protesting farmers. They came from different parts of India and were protesting the conditions in which they are forced to make a living. Both the leaders of the groups and opposition politicians who lent support came up with solutions. Unfortunately, they are hackneyed and unlikely to work. However, the problem is real. Large parts of the agrarian economy are in crisis. Output price increases have often lagged growth in costs resulting in an income squeeze.Farmers by virtue of numbers represent a powerful group that is heard. One symptom is the preponderance of farm loan waivers offered by all major political parties in elections. However, waivers have not solved the core problems. India is in an unusual situation. It is not drought which triggers repeated crises as much as low food prices. A part of it can be traced to a messy agricultural policy which has resulted in a web of cross-subsidies which does not seem to benefit marginal farmers. Increasing minimum support price has lost its efficacy on account of inadequate state capacity to procure adequate stocks.It’s not as if state governments have not embarked on reform measures. From Telangana’s upfront investment subsidy to farmers, Karnataka’s electronic market and Maharashtra’s attempt to break the hold of trader cartels, governments have chipped away. That has clearly not proven enough. It’s important for governments to quickly dismantle interstate barriers in movement of produce and avoid export bans. If government can increase fuel taxes to capitalise on international price movements, why deprive farmers of the same benefit? Moreover, all these solutions need to be backed by labour-intensive industrialisation – the only proven route to prosperity for rural poor in history.818 days ago This Govt is failed to understand root causes of Farmers distress.

Symptomatic of widespread agrarian distress, the country has been seeing several largescale farmers’ protests. Notable examples include the violent gathering in Mandsaur last June and the non-violent march from Nashik to Mumbai this March.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-112947\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delhi-Farmers-March-November-29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delhi-Farmers-March-November-29.jpg 1200w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delhi-Farmers-March-November-29-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delhi-Farmers-March-November-29-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delhi-Farmers-March-November-29-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\">The high-stakes five-states election season has of course raised the political pitch on farmers’ distress. Party manifestos are in serious competition to outdo each other on promises relating to more loan waivers and higher crop prices. As this kind of thinking has come to define government policies on agriculture, public capital formation in agriculture has been declining, at a time when a globally transforming agri-economy requires India to upgrade as well.Research shows that expenditure on agri research, education and roads is 5-10 times more effective than input subsidies. Likewise income support is more effective than pricing support, as Telangana is showing. Land leasing policies need liberalising. India also needs to catch up with the global biotech revolution. Its agri-markets are crying for structural reforms that would put more of the consumer’s rupees into the farmer’s pocket. And finally, India pressingly needs to grow non-farm jobs.Read also: Kisan March – Farmers from across the country gather in Delhi819 days ago 1. We know that politicians make promises to all farmers, particularly small/ marginalised farmers. These small farmers often work as part time farm labourers. Obviously they need alternate sources of income to support income from farming activity but who cares for them? They often get misled by the politiciansâ   promises. Bitter truth is that once these politicians are in power they conveniently forget to take care of small farmers. All political parties are interested to protect interests of big farmers, who have money and power. 2. Let us therefore try to find an honest answer to this question: who gets benefit of decisions like loan waivers and minimum support price? As an urbanite I believe that governmentâ  s agenda should be welfare of a majority of small farmers. In this connection I wish to refer to findings of a government agencyâ  National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). 3. NSSO report of 2013 says that farmers owning up to 1 hectare of land constitute 69.4% of total agricultural households in our country. I think it is these rural households which should be target of the governmentâ  s farmer welfare programmes. Many of them, I understand, are chronically in debt and are dependent on rich farmers and landlords to advance them the money needed for cultivation and they are often forced to sell their produce to these financiers at lower than market prices. In short, almost 70% of farming households in our country are unlikely to be beneficiaries of any programmes like MSP hike, loan waivers, etc. 4. Then, my query is this: how many political parties including BJP are ready to accept that whatever has been done so in name of farmersâ   welfare has not really benefited the farmers. It is time both the Central & State Governments devote a good part of their Agriculture budget for benefit of 70% of rural households. These households require maximum support from government, but I believe not one government has recognised their needs properly and provided it till date. Do farmersâ   organisations fight for them? Unfortunately answer is NO. 5. My view is that citizens who live in towns, cities and metros are definitely aware of small farmersâ   problems but they have little faith in existing programmes for farmers. We citizens would be willing to pay a surcharge on income tax if proceeds of this surcharge are directly credited to small farmersâ   bank accounts....

        "article": "All of a sudden it seems to be Kashmir in Madhya Pradesh: at least five protesters shot dead in Mandsaur district, prohibitory orders and internet shutdowns enforced. The difference is that MP’s turmoil is not the outcome of a political protest led by separatists but rather an economic protest led by farmers; ironically, in a state often upheld by BJP as a model of agricultural progress. Elsewhere, in neighbouring Maharashtra, far-off Tamil Nadu or other states, farmers are seething with discontent – despite a normal monsoon last year and robust produce.This is testimony to the deep-seated crisis in India’s agricultural economy and must serve as a wake-up call to the Centre as well as state governments. The usual populist fixes – such as farm loan waivers – is not going to defuse this crisis. Rather, policy makers must now remove the structural bottlenecks in India’s farm economy. Agriculture supports more than half of India’s population but makes up just 15% of its economic activity. It follows that holistic solutions to farmer distress will have to combine creation of non-farm jobs and enhancement of farm incomes.A bird’s eye view of agriculture points to an anomaly. Around 77% of farmland is devoted to staples such as cereals. This results in output almost equivalent to what high value crops such as fruits and vegetables yield on less than 20% of the land. Rectifying this mismatch will solve many problems. This is where government policy has a crucial role to play. The Indian farmer has to function in an overregulated environment made worse by capricious bans on exports. This is compounded by restrictions on internal food trade, unfounded fear of new technology such as genetically modified crops and the new bogey that has coincided with the unchecked rise of gau rakshaks: restrictions on cattle trade.States have a crucial role to play here as they make policy on marketing of high value perishables such as fruits. For example, when Karnataka took the initiative a couple of years ago by creating an online marketplace and breaking the grip of vested interests, there was marked increase in prices received by farmers. Better designed farm insurance policies which provide timely relief can mitigate adverse climatic impacts. A combination of lighter and smarter regulation and improvements in areas such as insurance will make a critical difference.1359 days ago looks like the farmer agitation has been hijacked by  payed criminals by opportunistic parties. people who can burn more than 40 buses and transport vehicles fully loaded with travllers, pelt stone on people, beat dms, plunder shops  and trucks, burn police stations and damage public properties are defenitely  not farmers. if it is them, then they should be taken to task according tothe law. this is not agitation but crime....

With farmers threatening to block dairy and vegetable supplies it is not just governments but residents in cities who will also feel the heat. The protesters are demanding complete loan waivers, assured income for farmers, and higher minimum support prices. But while such measures can be a political salve that addresses the immediate problems of some farmers, these cannot free them from being perpetually at the mercy of governments, middlemen and moneylenders.It is licence raj era regulations tailored for foodgrain security that have truly broken the farmers. So the state must bite the bullet and remove regulations that prevent farmers from accessing larger markets and restrict export. Next, help farmers by facilitating long-term purchase agreements with agro companies that can set up warehouses and cold chains. It is also time to recognise that MSP and loan waiver schemes are not reaching those farmers who face repeated price shocks and are in the grip of a trader mafia.Dismantling of APMC raj has begun in states like Maharashtra and Bihar but the benefits will become evident only when all states follow suit and markets are integrated. Many of these measures are politically difficult and will face resistance from traders and Left groups who will dub it as selling out to corporate interests. Even Madhya Pradesh’s innovative Bhavantar yojana to pay farmers the differential between MSP and mandi rates without the state getting into the logistics of procurement has failed during price crashes, a reason for the renewed protests this year. The focus must shift from compensating farmers to freeing them from rules and structures that depress farmgate prices.998 days ago Given our climate, rich solid and availability of labor, India can easily become the top most exporter of agricultural products.

        "article": "Canadian PM Justin Trudeau’s comments supporting the farmers’ agitation in India, made on the occasion of Gurpurab, smack of rank political opportunism. Trudeau said that Canada would always defend the right of peaceful protest and had already reached out to Indian authorities to highlight its concerns. It’s exceedingly odd that Trudeau should have chosen to wade into a domestic matter such as India’s farm laws, for a number of reasons.For one, Canada has been among the most vocal challengers at the WTO to India’s food subsidy programme for staple crops, which farmers are seeking to boost now. It would seem, then, that by backing the protests Trudeau wishes to place the Indian government in a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ type of situation. Second, since Trudeau is keen to certify the “peaceful” character of the farm protests, it’s an interesting question how his government would have reacted if, say, protesters had moved to block all entry routes to Ottawa. Would Trudeau have instructed Canadian law enforcement to stand aside, and allow the blockade to proceed? All of this suggests a double standard, which New Delhi should dismiss with the contempt it deserves.The reason Trudeau feels compelled to comment on the farmer agitation is most likely the sizeable Punjabi community in Canada, many of whose members still have agricultural lands in Punjab and happen to be sympathetic to the farm protests. Trudeau evidently places a higher premium on currying favour with this domestic constituency than on relations with New Delhi. But this isn’t the first time that Trudeau has ruffled India’s feathers. His 2018 trip to India turned into a fiasco over Canadian government invitations to a Khalistani militant. Trudeau would do well to be more circumspect. His political games can jeopardise India-Canada relations.85 days ago Trudeau is a leftist hype. His fall will be as spectacular as his rise has been.

The status quo, including minimum support prices, isn’t helping enough farmers unlike direct benefit transfers, besides distorting markets and cropping patterns too.Centre has clarified that it isn’t undermining APMCs or MSPs but merely increasing competition by allowing agribusinesses, food processors, wholesalers, exporters and big retailers to source directly from farmers. Opposition parties are joining the protests for political mileage, but government must improve its messaging on the salience of these reforms. Besides politicisation, the other weakness is the variance between policy and practice. Despite amending the Essential Commodities Act to remove stockholding limits and intemperate regulations on most commonly consumed commodities, Centre has again banned onion exports. Such moves run counter to the professed desire to find new export markets and hinder farmers from securing the benefit of even small increases in wholesale prices.160 days ago Why you are not calling out papou, adhir fool and some other opposition leaders who are misleading the farmars?Instead of only lecturing what government should do, responsible national newsmedia shall continuously explained the public, farmers and all what is good for them and general economy....

        "article": "The farmers’ movement has found its Momala. She is sequinned, stilettoed, and has an operatic moral compass. When Rihanna, she of over 100 million followers worldwide, tweeted, “Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest,” that was impactful enough, taking the Indian farmers to so many places they had never gone before. But all credit also to our resident ‘revolver rani’, Kangana Ranaut, who amplified the original tweet with lots of figmental and smutty compost, including the sensational claim that the protests are a plot to make India “a Chinese colony much like USA.” Lols.If she pays attention to this cockeyed theory, the chilled Barbadian would likely dismiss it with a grin, “Love the way you lie.” But desi twitterati won’t cool it. After all, candy crush is nothing to celebrity crush, by which you now carve your likes, dislikes, selfies, shelfies, bedrooms, bathrooms, really the list is unending. Your idol shapes your life. Like the Rihanna song goes, “You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh,” the idol promises. Don’t think for yourself, let the idol tell you what to think.  Budget in one soundbite, policy in a tweet, and philosophy reduced to meme.There is a deep intolerance inherent in such barricades of the mind. Right-wing trolls have unleashed a racist, sexist, communal frenzy against Rihanna. There is reductiveness on the other side too, although nowhere near as foul and vomitty, where the popstar has been overnight elevated into Khaleesi, dragon mother safeguarding India’s farmers. And India’s foreign ministry has done itself no favours by thin-skinnedly wading into this flamefest. To get an educated and balanced perspective on farm reforms, triggersome Twitter is the wrong place. It’s where you go to put yourself “four, five seconds from wildin.”22 days ago It is interesting that people with little knowledge about farmers in their own country have an opinion about the farmer's issue in India. Furthermore, most of the information Rihanna has on this issue is likely to be fake. The so called supporters of the farmers are busy spreading fake tweets on social media about how they are being brutalized. When the truth is totally opposite. These so called protestors caused riots and large scale violence against the Delhi Police. Does Rihanna know about that? Are the editors of this newspaper demonstrating their usual slavery to their western masters? BTW, Rihanna used an Islamic Hadith in a lingerie show. At least now you can stop being serious about her!...  Read More          This article is intended to bring a smile to your face.

        "headline": "Capital anarchy: Farmers deviating from peaceful protest route severely discredits their movement",
        "date": "January 26, 2021, 10:16 PM  IST",
        "article": "In what can perhaps be described as India’s Capitol insurrection moment protesting farmers upstaged the traditional Republic Day parade by deviating from the pre-designated routes of their tractor rally, violently breaking through police barricades, clashing with police personnel, and audaciously storming Red Fort – a symbol of the Indian Republic. They also vandalised buses and police vehicles as they entered Delhi in large numbers. That such chaos unfolded on Republic Day, when the capital is supposed to be a high security zone, is a monumental security lapse that’s comparable to the breach of the US Capitol early this year.While farmer union leaders are now trying to distance themselves from the violence and alleging the role of miscreants in the chaos, there’s no denying that the events of the day will tarnish their movement. Irrespective of their grievances, nothing can justify the farmers taking the law into their own hands. In fact, through their indiscretion they have undermined public sympathy for their cause. This is also a sign that leaders of the farmer agitation, whose exhortations are hardly obeyed, are losing control over their followers.Having struck a maximalist stance against the government’s farm bills and eschewed a negotiated settlement, frustration could be building up among farmers’ ranks. And these may have boiled over in the anarchy unleashed in the capital. That farmers raised the Sikh flag from the ramparts of Red Fort – seen as symbol of Indian national sovereignty which sports the tricolour – will also be seen as provocative and further delegitimise the farmers’ movement. The farmers have also threatened to march to Parliament on Budget Day. However, not only must the disruption in people’s lives caused by violent agitations in the national capital not be permitted to continue, a thorough investigation must also be conducted into security lapses on Republic Day.Apart from the breakdown of law and order, there might be a larger breakdown of the social contract here. With the fast paced growth that India had experienced in the first decade of this century having slowed down, economic momentum has been lost and the sort of jobs and livelihoods that people expect are not forthcoming. The longer term task of the government, therefore, is to restore rapid and sustainable economic growth and ensure India’s demographic dividend doesn’t turn into its demographic burden. One looks forward to Budget Day next Monday for some concrete assurance on this.30 days ago This is no farm protest as noted by many who comment here. This is an act of treachery of the wretched communists and their Congress and AAP friends. All of India has watched this treacherous act of hooliganism and destruction of public property. This so called farmers were building up the momentum for this act just like they were building up for the communal riots at Shaheenbag. Editors like you who still try to mix the truth with half truths and lies are very much responsible for the frenzy. Now, you will shamelessly blame the law and order. How does preserve law and order when attacked by a rowdy crowd two orders of higher magnitude? Are you suggesting that the police should have fired at the crowd? Explicitly or implicitly, you are trying to justify this unpardonable behavior of the rowdies. There are some who are almost having fun - like the joker Rajdeep Sardesai, who yet again sent out a fake tweet and later on deleting it. I really hope that these communists and their supporters (including the shameless editors of this newspaper and the Rajdeep Sardesais) one day pay for this....

        "article": "There is an unusual bandh call today. It’s been initiated by farmers and supported by many opposition parties. Yet, farmers have asked political parties to keep away. The entire issue shows up the failure of the political process in legislating new laws. This has come about because the Parliament has been reduced to a relatively meaningless institution in the process of legislation.Consider the way the government has dealt with farmers over the last few days. They have been invited for meetings with members of the Union cabinet and reports suggest that the government is willing to dilute some provisions of the three Central farm laws but not annul it completely.It’s a strange situation. The government is willing to discuss the farm laws with unelected farmers. Yet, when it had a chance to mitigate potential trouble by using the tried and tested route of the parliamentary standing committee, it chose to avoid it. A parliamentary standing committee’s recommendations are not binding on the government. But they have long played an important role in gaining wider acceptance of legislation.‘Bharat Bandh’ today, farmers hold protests across states: Key pointsThe consequences of undermining the parliamentary process should be clear from the current episode.80 days ago The laws were passed correctly and definitely are good for farmers.

        "date": "December 21, 2020, 7:44 PM  IST",
        "article": "Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday recommended that the lower house of Parliament be dissolved and fresh elections be held. The country’s president acceded to the request and announced that elections will be held over April and May next year. The legality of the development is contested and the last word hasn’t been said. Regardless, Nepal is set for a period of political instability as Oli’s decision comes on the heels of irreconcilable differences within the governing Nepal Communist Party. A section of the party has even initiated disciplinary action against Oli over Sunday’s development.The political turmoil comes at a difficult moment. Nepal has been hit hard by the fallout of the pandemic as tourism and remittances play important roles in the economy. In addition, there have been other challenges such as sugarcane farmers protesting in Kathmandu over unpaid dues. Oli, who has been in office for almost three years, has shown a pronounced tilt towards China in foreign policy. Simultaneously, the relationship with India deteriorated, with the cabinet’s approval in May of an updated political map marking a low point. China, through the office of its ambassador to Nepal, has also played a direct role in domestic politics.The Indian government will watch the developments in coming days with interest. None of the differences between the two countries are irreconcilable. They have a unique relationship, as an open border and free movement of people between sovereign neighbours are rarely seen anywhere else in Asia. This remains the foundation of an enduring but sometimes prickly friendship. Regardless of how the fluid political situation plays out, it is in the interest of both countries to lower the temperature and find ways to resolve differences. Nepal can ill afford political turmoil at this time. Hopefully wiser counsel will prevail.66 days ago PM Oli has acted in haste, with the President disinclined to urge reconsideration of a panicky recommendation. It now falls to the Supreme Court to consider whether the Constitution permits plunging the nation into an unnecessary mid term election. At a time of pandemic and considerable economic suffering. Given the disposition of numbers within the two dominant factions of the NCP - seven Cabinet ministers have resigned in protest - it is by no means certain that he can win the summer election. He won the last one by whipping up anti India sentiment. There is talk of reviving monarchist forces to generate support for him. He has also refused to honour the power sharing agreement with Shri P K Dahal. No friend of Indiaâ  s, for sure....

It was cleared amidst protests by JD(S) and Congress. The bill now awaits the governor’s assent.The essence of the bill is that it closes the door for disposal of cows to slaughter houses even after they have stopped producing milk.

Investment in cattle represents an economic decision for farmers. By restricting options for the disposal of an asset, the bill changes the economics of dairy farming, particularly for small farmers. The main consequence of the bill is that it hurts farmers and will partially offset the benefits of the three central laws passed by Parliament in September which aim to provide more choice to farmers.The governor should withhold assent.Read also: Anti-cow slaughter bill passed in Karnataka legislative council17 days ago India has become a tough place to live in.

        "date": "February 16, 2021, 7:42 AM  IST",
        "article": "Delhi police’s arrest of young climate activist Disha Ravi on multiple charges like sedition, criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity between groups – alleging her involvement in a farm agitation toolkit publicised by Greta Thunberg – appears disproportionate. Police sought Disha’s custodial remand to ‘unearth’ her purported links to a Khalistani group that allegedly originated the toolkit. Police have claimed that events unfolding in Delhi including the January 26 violence reveal execution of the “action plan” detailed in the toolkit Greta initially posted and then deleted. But this allegation will be scrutinised against the feeble ground presence of Disha’s Fridays For Future India group.The police’s task is to gauge if the yardsticks for invoking sedition like incitement to imminent violence can be applied against a ragtag bunch of activists led by Disha. Globally, toolkits are used by activist groups to provide basic information about their cause and offer suggestions on social media tags and on-site protests. However, Delhi police has only itself to blame for the public outrage now. Disha’s hush-hush arrest with no clarity on whether a transit remand from a Bengaluru court was obtained and the remand hearing in Delhi where she was represented by a legal aid counsel rather than a lawyer of her choice lead to questions on whether her constitutional rights were prejudiced.The police action, if intended to quell the domestic and international left-wing support that the farm agitation has evoked, is having the opposite effect of alienating more domestic constituencies like farmers and youth. A youth movement, against what they see as intransigence of older generations on climate change, is gathering pace. If climate activists are misinformed about the farm laws and fail to recognise the culpability of the current MSP regime for groundwater depletion and air pollution, a conversation can be initiated.If high handed actions are undertaken instead even liberal opinion, which keeps its distance from the Left, will turn. Those supporting the farm laws may prefer silence now, for concern that their principled position on reforms will be misunderstood as support for heavy handed tactics. Certainly, the alleged Khalistani hand can be unravelled without an ungainly hitching of that menace to little known green activists. Arrest the draining away of international soft power, stop seeing activists as seditionists.10 days ago Too much of democracy in India has proped up all types of activists. They include who can abuse PM and the country in a dirties manner, call our Army a rapist organization, talk about cutting of chicken neck of India for separating north-eastern states, killing one billion Hindus in 15 minutes etc etc. There are still other \"tukde-tukde\" activists who openly indulge in sloganeering of disintegration of India and speak language of enemy country Pakistan and support Khalistan movement. They organise long sit-in dharnas on main highways and important public places putting common man in great inconvenience. They have links with foreign vested interests which are inimical to India's progress and get funds from them for anti-national activities, like opposing development projects in the name of environment and all government policies without going into their merits and spreading enmity between different sections of societies. If any police or legal action is taken against such elements oppotion parties come in their support immediately and play dirty politics. They spread misinformation  and confuse the public and put impediments in the process of law to take its own course. The public in turn indulge in riotings and damage of public property.

        "date": "December 9, 2020, 7:24 AM  IST",
        "article": "In most states yesterday’s Bharat Bandh did not manifest memorably, suggesting that the Punjab protesters’ demand for rolling back the agricultural reforms is not as widespread as it looks to a capital under siege. States which have either not seen MSP munificence in the first place or where crop patterns have tended towards greater diversification and market linkages, are simply not in the same boat. As for the state that once boasted the highest per capita income, Punjab’s overdependence on public procurement of wheat and paddy has gradually made it uncompetitive and this is reflected in its decline in prosperity rankings.Fearful of further decline, the protesters want to stop change. They are suspicious of the agribusinesses which the new farm laws envisage will begin sourcing directly from farmers. The irony is that if their demands are met it will only diminish their future further, as also of the entire country.The Modi government did not do well to push these farm bills through Parliament autocratically. Since then, aside from repeated assurances that rumours about the imminent demise of MSP and the APMC mandis are false, it hasn’t done a sound job of communicating the freedoms that are in the offing. This is reflective of a political culture that cannot embrace freedoms, markets and reforms without hypocrisies, ambiguity and doublespeak. All parties are much more comfortable accusing opponents of threatening farmers’ livelihoods, than collaborating to actually uplift farm incomes.Out of India’s 146.45 million farm families 1.09 million are in Punjab. If the government compromises on MSP or the farm laws under pressure from the protesters, it would signal that any reform effort in India can be sabotaged by some interest group’s opposition and laying siege to the national capital. Many countries support their farmers with direct subsidies, and India needs to move in that direction with greater momentum. But the private commerce that has opened up new vistas from education to telecom must no longer be harshly restricted in agriculture. Repressive export policies must also be liberalised – this is something that government can offer to farmers. The 1991 lesson must not be forgotten. Closed systems do not mitigate risk, that’s a dangerous deception. As opposed to the terribly misguided demonetisation on which government wasted precious political capital, the reforms project has a model track record of delivering growth and opportunities. On it hinge all the big ticket dreams, from becoming a $5 trillion economy to doubling farmers’ incomes.79 days ago You are right.Government must not relent on this issue or for that matter on any issue of national importance to such tactics.These rich farmers have come fully prepared for months of agitation, complete with boarding, health care, security, wi fi and repairs [!] facilities.They appear well provided in every sense of the term.

        "article": "Following a six-day march from Nashik, thousands of farmers in Maharashtra yesterday camped near the seat of the state government to highlight their problems. This peaceful protest seeks to get the BJP-led state government to accept their demands, among which are unconditional waiver of loans and electricity bills and proper implementation of Forest Rights Act. The demands may be specific to Maharashtra but the underlying problems and their symptoms are visible across the country. India’s rural economy is in a crisis which needs to be addressed.Employing a little less than half the work force, agriculture makes up around 15% of the economy. The size of the pie here is very small. Fragmentation of land holdings and low yields are long standing problems. To add to them a new one has arisen: climate change. So far, government’s stock response has been to announce higher support prices or waive loans. Recent experience shows that these responses are at best palliatives. Structural reforms are the need of the hour.Over the last decade, agricultural investment has come largely from farmers while government has spent more on subsidies. Given the increasing risks faced by farmers and their limited resources, government should overturn its priorities and enhance investment. States in India often take the initiative. For example, Telangana government is working on a programme to provide farmers with working capital needs. This effort is crop neutral, transparent and leaves it to farmers to react to price signals. NDA should support such efforts and replicate them elsewhere.Other areas where the Centre can play a supportive role is to enhance agricultural technology. Bt cotton was a success story of the last decade, but this one has seen revival of pests such as whitefly and pink bollworm. Introduction of newer technology is an urgent need. However, the most durable solution will be to improve growth rates in other sectors. It is imperative to get young people into jobs in factories as they are more productive and offer better returns. The problems besetting restive farmers in Maharashtra may need immediate relief measures. But their children need more job openings in industry and services.1080 days ago PLEASE READ THE FNECT COMMENT FIRST AS THIS IS IN CONTIUATION THERESFYERhe Supreme court of India opined that I should have agitated my grievance of delayed payment with penal interest against DRT/Bank before  DRT itself.In furtherance to orders of the supreme court the executioner court has ordered me to repay ten million received by me in execution proceedings without adjusing the payable amount till 24.7.2008.

I have done no mistake, but worked sincerely and it is my payment  which the Bank is evading. The amount with penalty as per law has blown up in millions. but it is creation of bank itself. My first application to bank was only for basic payment. The delay of ten years  has raised the amount. I had to borrow heavily, sell personal assets.

        "date": "June 14, 2017, 6:52 PM  IST",
        "article": "Three years after Narendra Modi rode to Delhi on a forward-looking aspirational wave the national discourse is surprisingly feeling like a throwback to the 1980s, when rural distress and unemployment dominated the political narrative. Farmer protests in several parts of the country are now threatening to snowball into a major crisis for both the central and state governments. How these protests are handled in states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan – where assembly elections are due next year – carries extra political weight because these state results will help set the tone for the 2019 national elections.In MP, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s assiduously built agri success story is looking ragged now. In Karnataka, Siddaramaiah, the custodian of Congress’s last stronghold in the south, finds himself immersed in water shortage problems for sugarcane farmers, with opposition BJP threatening to rouse up another agitation if his government does not write off farm loans. In Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje is being cornered by both the Congress opposition and organisations linked to RSS, which are demanding better irrigation facilities and higher MSP for crops and of course farm loan waivers.Agriculture contributes about 17% of GDP but employs around 50% of the country’s workforce. This is simply unsustainable. Playing the narrow politics of agitations and waivers neither the BJP nor Congress leadership is showing effective leadership on the national imperative to move a greater portion of the agri workforce into other industries, to create new jobs, especially more high-productivity and high-wage jobs. It’s not just about unemployment. Niti Aayog has stressed that India also has a severe underemployment problem. A young mob increasingly short of work even in harvesting and sowing seasons portends more rancourous protests in the future.The MP, Karnataka and Rajasthan chief ministers may be counting too much on the infighting in opposition ranks in their states. Chouhan and Raje may also draw strength from the continuing popularity of the prime minister, which would help them at the hustings next year. But when farmers are in acute distress even in states with very high crop productivity, it really should be wake-up call for political parties to build a constructive consensus on innovative agricultural and jobs policies.

        "date": "January 12, 2021, 8:31 PM  IST",
        "article": "Supreme Court’s stay on operationalisation of the three farm laws, while setting up an expert committee to hold talks with stakeholders, puts the judiciary on a road rarely traversed. Since December, SC has voiced its unhappiness with the government’s mishandling of the farm agitation at Delhi’s borders. It has expressed concern for the physical and mental health of protesters, lack of wide consultations while tabling the bills, and warned of bloodshed. SC’s noble intent on all these aspects, however, cannot detract from the constitutional scheme of separation of powers.This carves out the policy and maintenance of public order spheres to the executive and vests the interpretation of laws with the judiciary. The political and socio-economic issues driving the farm agitation and ensuring peace in Delhi are the executive’s headache. The justiciable elements in the imbroglio include competence of Parliament to legislate on agriculture, undermining of state levies on farm trade, and denying farmers right to judicial recourse for enforcement of contracts. Suspending laws passed by Parliament requires invoking legal and constitutional principles at the outset. So courts have ordinarily let laws be or allowed governments to hold them in abeyance while hearing legal challenges against them.The SC expert panel’s mandate to talk with farmers was originally a parliamentary committee’s remit, bypassing that option damaged government politically. The experts may inform SC about qualitative aspects of the new farm policy. But those are choices best left to governments with their extensive bureaucracy. Judiciary acting on policy prescriptions of experts can complicate the situation where some farmers demand repeal and others offer support. The expert committee’s report and its negotiations deciding the fate of laws or the course of agitations can send subversive signals too. Powerful interest groups demanding concessions may be emboldened to adopt similar pressure tactics to bypass government and Parliament.Proactiveness on the essentially political farm agitation is at odds with the passivity in determining constitutionality of recent anti-interfaith marriage laws, CAA, or even the archaic sedition law. In sedition the narrow guardrails erected by SC, like incitement of imminent violence, are frequently disregarded when authorities haul up citizens for dissent. Laws that smack of executive overreach, putting individual freedoms and equality in jeopardy, make themselves ready candidates for SC scrutiny. In contrast, stepping out of its judicial comfort zone to quell agitations and untangle policies, without the executive’s resources or mandate, is a needless risk.44 days ago It is unfortunate that a law passed duly authenticated by appropriate authorities  is in doldrums inviting Judiciary  for intervention and pass direction.The matter should have been soved from the talks that took  place time and again with the Government.

        "date": "September 27, 2020, 8:35 PM  IST",
        "article": "Akali Dal’s exit from the NDA is a loss for BJP that goes beyond the limited numbers game in Parliament. Ties between the two parties date back to the Jan Sangh days, making Akali Dal perhaps BJP’s oldest ally. Though the split was precipitated by resistance in Punjab to the farm reform legislations, relations had nosedived in recent years. Choosing the farm bills to exit NDA is a weak gambit. The bills promise better prices and greater freedom to small farmers to market their produce. Akali Dal may have missed a trick by cosying up to protesters, instead of turning the food processing industries ministry under its belt into a force multiplier for reforms and agricultural prosperity.But each lost ally and the growing gap between the rhetoric and reality of “cooperative federalism” makes it harder for BJP to push its national agenda. In Maharashtra and Jharkhand, BJP failed to accommodate Shiv Sena and AJSU, ceding two states to UPA. Supportive or neutral parties like AIADMK, BJD, YSRCP and TRS may help BJP undermine opposition unity. But the Centre’s tightfisted approach on GST compensation, telling states to borrow to meet shortfalls, and CAG’s finding that Centre retained Rs 47,000 crore of GST compensation cess in 2017-19 to understate the fiscal deficit, could undermine trust between BJP and regional parties. While the finance ministry has refuted the CAG report, it’s worth noting that adverse CAG reports on the previous UPA government helped the current NDA drive it out of power.Many of its allies and friends, including JD(U), are uncomfortable with BJP’s hard-edged Hindutva: One manifestation was the CAA late last year that spawned large scale protests. Sukhbir Singh Badal has attacked Centre’s “callous insensitivity” to minority sentiments. The shift from the Vajpayee era’s emphasis on coalition dharma to the Modi era’s emphasis on single party dominance has left allies chafing. Neither have BJP’s sharp tactics in pushing through legislation in the just concluded monsoon session of Parliament – without much discussion or debate, and including the controversial passage through just a voice vote of the crucial farm bills – endeared it to other parties.BJP needs to develop a more accommodating style, reach out to political parties across the spectrum and build political capital with allies and potential allies. Else it may face increasing resistance in Parliament or in states – even when it is pursuing a productive agenda.151 days ago Not at the cost of principle.These are excellent bills.Someone has to think of the interest of the nation and not of election politics all the time.\"If nobody responds to your call,walk alone\"....

        "date": "September 21, 2020, 10:14 PM  IST",
        "article": "The passage of two key farm reform bills by Parliament with the potential to boost farm incomes and productivity should have been a historic occasion. When Parliament is called upon to perform its job of discussing, scrutinising and enacting pathbreaking legislations, the government of the day must go out of the way to ensure orderly functioning and build a consensus, if possible. Unfortunately, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not get the solidarity they deserved.While envisaging a big leap in agricultural trade, the legislations chip away at regulatory privileges enjoyed by state governments. This has stoked farmer unrest in some states and many non-BJP ruled states, and opposition MPs, commanding respectable numbers in Rajya Sabha, came prepared for a confrontation. Two key demands – examination of bills by a select committee and deferment of headcount – didn’t find favour with the government and the House chair. Checks and balances enshrined in parliamentary processes must be given their due respect. In a truncated session, MPs have had little say in the two important legislations, promulgated as ordinances earlier. A select committee could have made suggestions and amendments palatable to the opposition and useful for the government. But that was not to be.Reliance on a voice vote hasn’t helped the government either. This allowed the opposition to question the numbers in support of the bill. A contested passage doesn’t portend well for the Centre. It could increase resistance on the ground and give momentum to protests. That could in turn hold up more reforms that are keenly needed. Citing the divisiveness, opposing states could throttle the reforms, as has happened to many well-intentioned schemes.Opposition’s attempt to create a spectacle of protest by heckling the deputy chairman at very close quarters, breaking a mic, and tearing official papers was crass and self-defeating. A race to the bottom with no winners is evident in Rajya Sabha TV arbitrarily muting the live feed before the House adjourned, purportedly to prevent airing of the commotion to a national audience, and the MPs recording their own shenanigans on smartphones. Far from impressing ordinary citizens, the political divisiveness is deeply distressing for them. Parliament must serve to reassure the public, uphold due process and serve as an oasis of calm, reasoned debate amid a worsening economic crisis.157 days ago The government did a great job passing the laws in both the houses especially the Rajya Sabha. Your argument about political consensus has no merit. How can the Modi government discuss anything with an opposition whose arguments are based entirely on lies and deceit? The opposition has no consideration for the farmers of India. They just wanted to score political points through misinformation. They never offer any constructive advice. They either want to delay or kill every legislation the Modi government brings. Moreover, look at the street goondaism of Sanjay Singh, Derek O'Brien etc. Thankfully, due to the majority in the Lok Sabha and the support of other parties in the Rajya Sabha, Modiji continues to get work done for the betterment of the poor for the first time since 1947.

After all, it is the executive’s prerogative to make farm policies and the legislature’s to frame laws. The SC’s primary mandate, on the other hand, is to ensure laws are in conformity with the Constitution of the country. As long as that basic test is met, the executive is free to legislate new laws through Parliament.Read more | Farm laws put on hold: What the SC said in its interim orderThat said, the government could have done a better job of consulting farmers and seeking greater opinion on the laws by putting the bills through parliamentary standing committees. The failure to do so created an impression that government was ramming the legislations through. But that is a separate point. The farmers are challenging the laws because they don’t agree with the market-oriented reforms government is pushing. However, this isn’t a matter of fundamental rights. Government can’t be expected to ensure particular farming conditions remain in perpetuity.Thus, it remains to be seen what conclusions the SC reaches. The court has already indicated that it can’t suspend the laws indefinitely. Hopefully better sense will prevail all around.44 days ago SC judges seem to be ignorant of what is happening to the common man because of the farmersâ   protest.  Why did the judge not ask the farmers to clear the high-ways for the common man?  This was the priority issue.  Secondly, SC should have clearly given a verdict either in favour of the farmers or in favour of the law.  Why does it play politics like politicians?  The judges are appointed to give verdict and not to give suggestions to the committee.   Their judgement should be either this way or that way.  The other way is to postpone the case, but surely not to negotiate.  Now, the farmers unions have rejected SC courts order for forming a committee to solve the issue.  What next by the SC?  Should the common man suffer forever because of the blockade of roads?  What action the SC is going to take against the farmers who are going to disturb the Republic Day parade?

        "date": "December 4, 2018, 7:26 PM  IST",
        "article": "The shocking attack on police in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr district by a mob protesting alleged cow slaughter highlights the extent to which cow vigilantes have been emboldened. Trouble began after locals from Mahav village allegedly found cow carcasses in a nearby forest. This led to a right-wing protest against the police which went out of control. Subsequent violence saw Syana station officer Subodh Kumar Singh being killed after he took a bullet to his head. There was police firing and an agitator also died, as the mob set several vehicles on fire and torched the Chingrawati police outpost.The mayhem follows from a culture of impunity that cow vigilantes have come to enjoy in states like UP, where police often don’t even prosecute their crimes sincerely. What the Bulandshahr episode exposes is that the monster is running wild now and can hardly be controlled by any political masters. Meanwhile, from Mohammad Akhlaq to Pehlu Khan, most victims of cow vigilantism are yet to see the light of justice with their cases proceeding at glacial pace. In fact, those accused of killing Akhlaq are out on bail and one of them has even announced his intention to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In an atmosphere where vigilante groups feel emboldened to take the law into their own hands, Bulandshahr shows them turning on the law itself.This will worsen conditions for an already ailing cow economy. For a country with the highest population of cattle in the world, slaughtering of unproductive animals or disposing of carcasses ought to be routine activities. But encouraged by BJP politics, vigilantism has really hurt the trade in cattle – which employs lakhs of people. Reports of unproductive cows roaming the countryside and becoming pests for farmers exemplify a worrying breakdown of the cow-centred animal husbandry sector.And UP appears to be at the heart of the problem. The state’s huge unemployed youth population not only provides foot soldiers to cow vigilante groups but security here also remains in a shambles. The Yogi Adityanath government’s so-called encounter killing drive highlights a police force and a political leadership that have run out of ideas to fix broken systems. Instead, their ham-handed approach is making the law and order situation worse. Perhaps Adityanath would do well to heed opposition advice to campaign less outside his state and focus on his UP chief minister’s job.814 days ago English Media may be with nexus owner of unregulated slaughter houses which is run since post-independence under the abetment of predecessor regime high light the accident mob occurrence to give bad name to the protectors of Cows, who are killed or slaughtered even has squarely judiciary-ban by minority without deterrence of law to deliberately provoke the sentiments of majority community.

        "date": "September 12, 2019, 8:03 PM  IST",
        "article": "History has been witness to the rise and fall of many cities. For the India story, the abandonment of Amaravati, billed at its foundation just four years ago as a “world-class, futuristic” city, is a distressing moment. The Andhra Pradesh government’s corruption probes into Amaravati projects during Chandrababu Naidu’s tenure and World Bank dropping its funding commitments after the Centre withdrew its finance request have slammed the brakes on the dream city. With too many unfinished projects Amaravati, into which thousands of crores of rupees have already been pumped in, is fast becoming a ghost town unless the Andhra government and Centre wake up to the impending disaster.While Naidu may have been guilty of conjuring an illusion beyond the state’s means, petty politicking is also a culprit here. Since coming to power after a landslide victory in May, YSRCP has been unrelenting in its efforts to collar TDP on corruption allegations. It believes that inside knowledge of Naidu’s plans helped those close to TDP corner Amaravati land and projects and book illegitimate gains. The losers in chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s crusade against Naidu also include thousands of ordinary citizens who staked their hard-earned money on Amaravati.Among them are farmers whose lands were acquired, the construction sector and homebuyers. From the outset Amaravati has faced teething troubles like messy land acquisition, funds shortage, and local opposition to the conversion of fertile farmland. But leaving a city half-built is self-defeating. Jagan must not take hasty steps he will repent later. He must also refrain from coercive measures like placing Naidu under house arrest. Strong-arm measures that curtail the democratic right to protest will boomerang. Ask CPM and TMC in Bengal.At some level, one can discern a parallel with the larger Indian reality. The Indian dream had soared in post-liberalisation years and seemed to be on the ascendant till about 2011. Now, however, it has soured, following years of excessive populism and its twin brother – political polarisation. Optimism has drained out, investments have been dull, share markets are in a bear hug, even demand and consumption are collapsing in a young country such as India. While the ruling BJP invests great energy in political organisation, political management and political communication, one can only hope it pays similar attention to reviving the economy, which is the key to realising India’s dreams and potential.532 days ago 1.

In this connection I wish to give example of Mumbai-Ahmadabad Bullet train project. This is a project which is of little use for a vast majority of ordinary citizens of both cities but it is still being pursued for political reasons. 2. Why this happens in a democratic country like ours? I say this happens irrespective of party in power and this happens because those who are in the ruling party think that they are not accountable to the citizen-voters.  3.

        "article": "The anti-corporate turn to the farm agitation is a fallout of the political class subordinating entrepreneurial spirit to political interests. Agriculture is India’s largest employment provider. No vote minded neta will shortchange millions of farmers to benefit a few corporates. The onus for farm reform comes, in fact, from the political compulsion of improving farm incomes. This compounds the irony of protesting farmers believing that government has the corporates’ back but not theirs. Another irony, just as striking, is that both the farmer and corporate are dependent on sarkari patronage for survival.Economic liberalisation since 1991 is a misnomer in that sense: Ease of doing business hasn’t really undermined the all pervasive influence of statism and made more space for civil society. Companies often survive or prosper at the pleasure of the government, with its control over policies, regulators and investigating agencies. A related irony is that corporate funding feeds election expenditure, yet the power differential allows netas to keep industrialists on a tight leash. Citizens, irrespective of class, frown upon this arrangement. From therein stems the anti-capitalist mood among farmers: The government-big business jodi are at pains to allay suspicion that state sanctioned mandis are subverted to favour corporate interest.The vilification of capitalism goes against the grain of evidence of India and Indians doing exceedingly well post-1991 compared to the previous socialist era. Even 2021’s hopes rest on the anti-Covid vaccines delivered in quick time by big pharma – often vilified for high drug prices – combining innovation and efficiency to expedite development, trials, data reporting and manufacturing. Small is beautiful, large is trouble: So went the Indian credo. Among its manifestations, tighter labour codes for bigger establishment sizes, counterintuitively, incentivised small entities to remain small and big ones to shed regular workers.In effect, state stymied industry and failed to take people out of agriculture. A blowback could be beginning with the youth demographic peaking. Instead of shying away from reforms after this setback, politicians must recognise their culpability in the popular disdain towards big business. Government needs to strive for an ecosystem where corporations are largely independent and can even criticise policies when the need arises. Transparency of political funding and truly independent sectoral regulators can become starting points for reforms, competition, innovation and risk taking. What big business achieves thenceforth may persuade farmers, landowners and other groups to embrace them. That, unfortunately, remains a path not yet taken in Indian politics.52 days ago You make some good points.

        "article": "Farmers’ protests are strongly gendered in our imagination. Many of us think of women playing only a supporting role there, making chapatis and singing to soothe the menfolk. This is a totally false and jaundiced characterisation. An NCAER estimate is that women comprise a high 42% of India’s agri labour force. Feminisation of agriculture has been pushed by the migration patterns that have defined the 21st century economy, where men seek jobs elsewhere while women stay back to look after the farming.But even the Chief Justice of India questioned this week why women (and old people) were being kept at the protests. It does seem as if the invisibilisation of female agri work has advanced quite a bit since Mother India, the 1957 film that melodramatically bared how rural women juggle the rolling pin and the plough. The latter has been widely replaced by the tractor. Machines have moved on, mindsets have regressed.Plus, the patriarchal laws and customs that carry on in states like UP, Punjab and Haryana also ensure that 83% of agricultural land is inherited by male members and less than 2% by female members of the family, as indicated by the IHDS nationwide survey. These archaic practices inflict both grave injustice and heavy economic toll, as women farmers are denied rightful access to markets, credit and other inputs. The nation needs to do a lot of work to correct this denial of rights and entitlements. Recognising women as farmers is just the first baby step. 41 days ago True .The agriculture work around the country is executed  with the able assistance of women workers.

        "article": "In June, the Centre promulgated three ordinances to reform agriculture. One of them, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) is potentially the most transformative. It aims to create a common national market for agricultural produce, with practically no entry barriers for participants. This ordinance, along with two others covering essential commodities and contract farming, should be approved in the forthcoming Parliament session. Almost all political parties, when in power, have supported increasing choices for farmers in marketing their produce. Therefore, June’s ordinances should receive their support.However, there have been sporadic protests by farmers and traders against these measures. In northwest India, farmers fear this is a prelude to phase out the minimum support price system, which works mainly for wheat and paddy. Other issues unrelated to the ordinances, such as proposed electricity reforms, have found their way into protests. The government needs to do better in clearing misconceptions. States too must provide support. Many had already begun agricultural marketing reforms before these ordinances were promulgated. One way they can help is by removing levies in wholesale markets. It will help create a level playing field with other traders and foster competition.If the June reforms are to live up to their potential, the Centre needs to follow through. An earlier attempt to create a national electronic trading platform produced unsatisfactory results because supporting infrastructure to aid market development wasn’t created. A potential challenge in the June ordinance is the trade dispute redressal platform.

        "date": "November 5, 2020, 8:24 PM  IST",
        "article": "For over a month, Punjab has found itself in a worrisome situation. An agitation protesting new farm laws began towards the end of September. It has snowballed into a situation where the state has for a month been largely deprived of railway freight movement. This has led to shortages, undermined reopening of industries and created a crisis in the power sector. The consequences are not limited to Punjab; they have spilled over to Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.The primary responsibility of dealing with law and order lies with the state government. Punjab’s Congress administration has fared poorly in this case. Farmers have a right to express their displeasure. But it’s the government’s responsibility to ensure their protests don’t disrupt life for others. The ongoing agitation, spearheaded by over 30 farmers’ organisations, conflates other issues. Bundled along with demands on the Centre’s legislations is the issue of power purchase agreements signed by the previous government. This has resulted in a separate blockade of two railway tracks leading to the relevant power plants. Altogether, the Railways estimates its loss exceeds Rs 1,200 crore.The matter hasn’t been helped by the maximalist stance taken by the Railways. Farmers have been willing to lift the blockade for freight trains. They did ply for a couple of days towards October end. But since then, Railways halted movement citing operational and safety considerations. The situation is untenable and the victims are common people. The current situation also poses strategic risks and undermines economic recovery. The Punjab government must get a grip on the situation. It’s the state government’s primary responsibility. Railways needs to climb down and operate freight trains on routes not being blockaded. Overall, this gridlock reflects poorly on governance in India.112 days ago Machiavellian Nehru dynasty instigated the farmers with manfactured lies ,few others bumped in to compete for votes.Now asking central govt to help.Clear the blockade , how can center do anything while you are blocking.roads and rail.Stop politics and ask your agents to clear.Punjab is not the only State that needs care all states do.but creating blockades and blaming central govt won't do....

        "date": "December 3, 2018, 7:35 PM  IST",
        "article": "Paris, the city of love, was shaken to the core this past weekend when hundreds of protesters ran amok, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques, destroying cafes and even vandalising the iconic Arc de Triomphe. More than 400 people had to be arrested and around 133 were injured. French President Emmanuel Macron hasn’t ruled out imposing a state of emergency. The immediate cause for the unrest may have been fuel tax hikes but the underlying anger driving the Yellow Vest movement stems from growing inequality and squeezing incomes, especially in France’s rural hamlets and provincial towns.Organised through social media and sans any political affiliations, the protesters have certainly taken the French administration by surprise. They accuse Macron of arrogance, mocking his environmental justification for fuel tax hikes when they hardly make ends meet with rising bills. A common refrain among the protesters is that they literally run out of money by the last week of the month.Macron dramatically rode to power last year, taking advantage of an anti-establishment wave that marginalised France’s centre-right Republicans and centre-left Socialists. He pitched himself as a reformer and vowed to overhaul the French welfare state. This is much needed to rev up the French economy; the tax and labour law reforms Macron has pushed through are steps in the right direction. But this also entails short-term pain for long-term gains. In fact, there are similarities here to the situation with Indian farmers who have been demanding loan waivers to ameliorate agriculture distress. And much like in the French situation, here too the only real solution lies in long-term agriculture reforms and moving farmers to manufacturing jobs. How deftly politicians, both in India and France, navigate the resistance to reforms will determine their future.814 days ago But nobody's calling Christian terrorism nor Christian poooorkistan nor Christian Taliban ....hi SickularsLeftardsLibtardsPressttutesGandiGulams y r u quite....

        "date": "June 13, 2019, 7:58 PM  IST",
        "article": "Eleven years after India launched its comprehensive lunar exploratory mission, becoming the fourth country after the US, Russia and China to join this elite club, its second mission to the Moon is coming up, on July 15. Chandrayaan 1 made global headlines by helping confirm the presence of water on Moon. The Indian Space Research Organisation also grabbed its slice of glory with Mangalyaan, for making it to the red planet on its first shot and at a bargain basement price. Now Chandrayaan 2 will soft-land a rover to gather intel on the Moon, unravelling its mysteries while also boosting ties with Nasa. It has a far more complex mission than Chandrayaan 1 which only included an orbiter and an impactor. Most importantly, this is all building up to the ambitious Gaganyaan project, where India is targeting a manned mission to space by 2022.In a country where gender inequality continues to drag down social and economic progress, what is quite remarkable about Chandrayaan 2 is that this interplanetary mission has a woman project director and a woman mission director. In fact women comprise around 30% of the team in charge of the mission. Even during earlier Isro missions like Mangalyaan, the launch images grabbed attention for the number of women in the control room. Not only does this break worldwide stereotypes of rocket science being the domain of men, it offers an encouraging glimpse of Indian organisations that do right by women and are much the better for it.Once upon a time space missions could be considered national vanity projects. Today they are an existential necessity. Because satellites today control a countless number of critical Earth functions such as communications and weather mapping. Given the reality that space is no longer a distinct entity outside human lives, it is welcome that India and Isro are upping their space game. This is a national security imperative now. But the kind of unconditional support for science that Isro has been getting needs extending across the country.This week saw farmers in Maharashtra protesting against the Centre’s ban on GM crops. This is a telling case. Activists on the left and the right have joined forces to block science in agriculture. But politics shouldn’t override scientific judgment. Until India continues to suffer this malaise, it will keep falling behind on patents and technological innovation. The Modi government should let science bloom everywhere.622 days ago Do we need to spend huge fund to go to the Moon which is already achieved by US before?

        "date": "February 3, 2021, 7:35 AM  IST",
        "article": "Disruptions in both Houses of Parliament yesterday – following the opposition clamour for repeal of the farm laws – portend another stormy session. Government and opposition aren’t budging an inch from their respective positions when the farm bills were passed in the monsoon session, without accepting the latter’s demand to refer it to a select committee. Since then the movement against farm reforms has gained in strength, forcing the government into protracted negotiations with farm unions.Cancellation of the winter session during this period, citing the pandemic, was poor optics. It signalled that India’s foremost deliberating body was nowhere in the picture during its biggest farm mobilisation. With the government’s offer to suspend the laws for 18 months not proving adequate to bring agitating farmers around, it’s only fitting that the impasse is debated in Parliament which enacted the laws. This may even find common ground. Unfortunately, a rational culture of debate and discussion has become a near impossibility. Bulldozing tactics on one side and stonewalling at the other end have rendered fruitful parliamentary functioning a casualty.One side unwilling to listen and the other unwilling to collaborate sums up the extent and costs of political polarisation. It reflects in the sedition cases slapped upon government critics and journalists by BJP-governed states or the opposition’s surly equating of much-needed privatisation to selling the family silver and crony capitalism. What happens with such partisanship is fairly obvious: Both the democratic rights of citizens and the democratic mandate to govern weaken. Farmers are claiming legitimacy for their protest citing the short shrift to Parliament. Since Parliament is the only forum bringing government and opposition together, the brinkmanship is felt instantly here as disrupted sessions. Restore the culture of debate to Parliament. A polity unafraid to confront its differences can unite the country in the urgent task of post-pandemic reconstruction.23 days ago There is no ego ... Those golden words, spoken by Krishi Mantriji, hold the best promise to end the stalemate, whether in Parliament or on the borders of Delhi, where tens of thousands of farmers have been camping in the open. 2. An eighteen month stay was not offered for the CA Act. It is manifest that the three farm laws have not been carefully thought through, discussed threadbare with all stakeholders, going beyond Parliament. Whether they are repealed and then re-enacted, or kept in abeyance while extensive changes are discussed, is now more a matter of prestige than real substance. Some will say the government blinked, others will say it demonstrated both flexibility and statesmanship. 3. The protests have been peaceful, barring the unfortunate incidents of 26th January. The images of deep trenches, concrete blocks, concertina wire are unsettling. This is a fraught situation where things could take an untoward turn. Better to carry not just the Opposition in Parliament and the farmers along the borders but the entire nation along. At a time when another set of people are camping along our sacred borders....

        "date": "January 25, 2021, 8:45 PM  IST",
        "article": "Although India has celebrated Republic Day every year since 1950, the celebrations get updated with the times, a kind of periodic rebranding. Some of this year’s changes have been forced by the pandemic. Jawans will march in masks and there will be no chief guest because rising infections in the UK made PM Boris Johnson cancel his visit. Other changes are purposeful. The parade will be led by a Bangladeshi tri-service contingent, underlining how 50 years ago Indian forces fought shoulder to shoulder with Mukti Bahini. But audiences will also be reminded how this neighbour’s per capita income is now crossing ours, and more generally how much shine Brand India has lost in recent years.This has a direct bearing on the most unusual feature of this year’s Republic Day, that farmers will be taking out a parallel tractor parade in the capital. The roots of this protest movement are similar to insistent and multiplying demands for caste based job reservations. In his 1992 budget speech, Manmohan Singh had outlined the long-term imperative to evolve patterns of production that would generate larger employment opportunities in higher income jobs. Significant shortfalls in this project have meant matching failures in moving workers from farm to factory, from informal to formal enterprises.The Indian economy had been losing momentum for eight quarters even before the Covid lockdown contracted it painfully which, as CMIE data shows, meant jobs lapsing further back into low productivity sectors such as agriculture. The problem of too many people being dependent on agriculture can’t be solved by only 9% of workers being employed in enterprises with 20 or more of them. All the growth stories of Asia tell us that it is larger economic units that build gainful employment, and these can only be delivered by greater integration with the global supply chain. There is no other path to lifting a large number of Indians into a middle class earning good and stable wages.In failing to open such paths the state is tempted to suppress protests by suppressing civil liberties. But this is untenable in a republic held together by democracy. Whether it was the 1991 economic reforms or the 2021 historic cricket victory Down Under, the lesson is we can claw back from adversity by betting on our human capital. Invest in it and let it fly. Protectionist and statist tendencies only worsen the yawning gap between India’s potential and performance.31 days ago If India is a troubled republic, no country in the world is not troubled. You selectively quote numbers to somehow show that Bangladesh is doing better than India. This has been countered by more accurate and complete set of numbers in other venues. Forget the numbers, if that were the case, why do we have illegal immigration from Bangladesh at such a large scale. Why don't these folks go back? Second, how do you justify the declining Hindu population in your favorite Bangladesh? I guess Hindus never mattered. You can selectively ignore that fact. What civil liberties have been stolen? That we should have not stopped the crowd of rowdies burn Bangalore due to a Facebook post? That we should have allowed an illegal Shaheenbag protest, causing nuisance to law abiding citizens, continue forever? The government has been utterly gentle with the so called Farmers protest (which actually is a communist protest) even though they broke cell towers, and are blocking roads, and hurting businesses. It is quite clear that the farmer's protest would end with some kind of a riot being instigated by the usual communists, congressis, and anarchists (AAP). The signs of that are already visible in the fake story that was presented to the media two days ago by the farmers about the possibility of violence. How does India get rid of pathetic liars and poison spreaders in the media, including the editors of this newspaper? Such riddance will result in true smile and shine. In a movie, someone asks that the \"world look very nice and peaceful today, what changed?\" The response was that the \"(pathetic) newsmedia is on strike\"....

This year’s Union budget is being watched keenly for measures to revive economic growth after successive years of disappointing performance on the economic front. It appears that India can now put most of the economically disruptive public health measures to contain the Covid pandemic behind it. But this is also the moment for the polity to unite in the pursuit of national goals.The government would have learned a lesson from its rushing of the farm reforms in the monsoon session without heeding opposition’s words of caution to refer the bills to a parliamentary committee. However, the budget session is again beginning on a wrong note with many opposition parties boycotting the President’s address to both houses. Walkouts don’t help either side. The opposition cannot claim to have made its position on legislations clear as it did on the farm bills if it stays out of the house.

        "article": "At a time when farmers’ protests have put it on the back foot, it’s welcome that the Modi government has doubled down on the reform agenda in the Budget instead of succumbing to populist pressure. Unprecedented use of the word ‘privatisation’ suggests that it may be moving out of the ‘reform by stealth’ mode into acknowledging more frontally what the economy needs to climb out of the hole it’s currently in. Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an important speech in Parliament on Wednesday, underlining that the time and world in which the government did everything are long gone. Now the private sector has to play a much bigger role in the India story. But that needs fighting our hidebound distrust of it: “How can we declare all of them dishonest?”The politicisation of economic reforms has been the country’s Achilles heel. Every time a government attempts them, an opposition party takes up the faux mantle of aam admi. The subtext of charges like ‘suit boot ki sarkar’ is that ‘dhoti kurta sarkar’ would be better. New votaries of preserving status quo in agriculture who have come up from Sweden to the US, would blanch at current Indian practices being replicated in their backyard. But experts have long noted that the NDA government with its historic majority and Modi with his enormous political capital, can break this impasse with candid advocacy of reforms.Time and again the gap between promises and execution has eroded trust in reform pledges. To win it back, the Modi government has to show actual progress in monetising assets, exiting non-strategic sectors. It also has to answer opposition charges of benefitting only select business houses, dispassionately and institutionally. Build the independent regulatory apparatus that will ensure competition. People’s doubts shouldn’t be vilified. The painstaking work of countering them with logic and hard evidence is absolutely necessary.14 days ago Modi govt. had never been against private business as an ideology. But the govt. had been vehemently against dishonesty and corruption. The message had been clear. Most welcome to carry out business but it has to be clean. It was like building a new India with new values. Honesty and speed - unprecedented and beyond even the imagination of people at large.
