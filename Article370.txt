        "date": "January 6, 2021, 3:50 PM  IST",
        "article": "The return of domestic tourists to the Kashmir valley and the recent conduct of the District Development Council elections offer an opportunity for the Centre and Kashmir politicians to pave the way for normalisation. Tourists visiting  Kashmir have registered a marked improvement in numbers from December 2019 in the aftermath of Article 370 nullification, but still trails levels seen in December 2018.Yet given how tourism was all but wiped out during the lockdown, the nearly twofold rise from 6,954 tourists in December 2019 to over 13,000 in December 2020 shows that Kashmir could be recovering from the twin blows dealt by Article 370 nullification and the Covid pandemic. Devolution of funds to DDCs will help the elected DDC representatives to get to work on the ground.Also read: After lockdown lull, Kashmir sees a rush of local touristsThe improvement in the security situation, which helped in the smooth conduct of the elections and now the return of tourists, also bodes well for the union territory. With 2021 poised to be a recovery year, helping Jammu and Kashmir script a political and economic turnaround must take top priority.51 days ago Mushad Ashgar talks about Kashmiri nation: is it the same as the one who carried out a genocide (of Kashmiri Pandits, the original inhabitants of the land), or is he telling us   that Kashmiri Muslims can not be a part of a democratic society.

        "article": "Centre and Jammu & Kashmir administration are facing tough questions on Congress politician Saifuddin Soz’s detention. No sooner had the Supreme Court disposed of a plea on Soz’s “illegal detention” based on J&K administration’s claim that he was a free man, Soz demonstrated to journalists how he was being prevented from leaving his house. A video of Soz visiting his ailing sister went viral on Friday. But the visible restraints on Soz’s movements by his sentries on Thursday before reporters don’t lie either. Before the former Union minister moves SC again, the administration must remove all doubts on his freedom.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-141365 size-full\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pic1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pic1.png 169w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pic1-45x52.png 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\">With the anniversary of Article 370 nullification approaching, Centre and J&K administration must make a distinction between political detainees like Soz or Mehbooba Mufti and those culpable for violent acts. Soz may be a vocal opponent of Article 370 nullification, but the absence of such political voices in the Valley creates a dangerous vacuum that separatists and terrorists can capitalise on. Many shades of Kashmiri public opinion are realistic that Article 370 isn’t coming back. If others do push for 370 then India, as a democracy, should permit such debate.Internet freedoms are also an extension of political freedoms; both are intimately connected to fundamental rights of free speech and living with dignity. Though August 5 is expected to be stormy, the administration mustn’t delay for too long afterwards to restore 4G mobile services which, particularly in times of Covid, are critical for online education and economic activities. Young Kashmiris have borne many such curbs for a year and the fear of Pakistan’s mischief has run its course as a reason for denying basic rights. Having asserted Kashmir’s integrality to India, the Centre must now let the Valley’s politicians and economy carry forward the process.209 days ago It is so much of pain to see an Article like this on Editorial of a New Paper which claims to be having national presence. What the hell these media houses were doing when these so called, traitor and shameless politicians were designing plots to make Kashmir Hindu free, what this News paper was doing when Islam**t terrorists, in coalesce with these so called blo**y leaders, killed thousands and forced Millions of Hindus out of the valley.

Mehbooba’s continued detention after the release of the Abdullahs had raised eyebrows.

With a sizeable domestic constituency still blaming the mainstream Valley parties for their plight, both the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party are on a weak wicket. Both NC-PDP and the political alternatives that are struggling to articulate a post-Article 370 vision for the Valley would fare better with the reinstatement of statehood, which the Centre hasn’t ruled out.A comprehensive economic package, and allowing resumption of 4G services could help break the political stalemate and change popular sentiment. With China turning aggressive in Ladakh, it is important to foil Pakistan’s objectives in the Kashmir Valley. Free and fair elections are important in this regard and police and security forces must ensure that attempts by militants to target politicians are foiled.135 days ago J&K people are not going to look at rotten bands Abdullas and Mufthis, they have a wider choice now to chose the people sevaks.

        "date": "February 18, 2020, 8:05 PM  IST",
        "article": "In what can only complicate matters in Assam if it comes to pass, a home ministry appointed committee – set up to suggest ways to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord – is learnt to have recommended the introduction of Inner Line Permit (ILP) for the state to control the influx of outsiders. ILP for Assam would mean even Indians from other states would need a permit to visit there. This would be extremely detrimental for investment and business in Assam. It could also put paid to hopes of actualising India’s Act East policy. After all, Assam and other Northeast states were supposed to serve as a land bridge between India and Southeast Asia. But identity politics is severely undermining those goals.If one wonders what led the home ministry committee to propose a self-goal such as this one, it arises out of the need to assuage Assamese opinion after the disquiet stemming from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The latter is seen by Assamese – particularly those in the Brahmaputra Valley – as violative of the 1985 Assam Accord as it seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh entering uptil December 31, 2014. The intensity of anti-CAA protests in Assam appears to have caught the Centre unawares – leading it to propose the ILP. Never mind that it opens up another, perhaps bigger can of worms.The NDA government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution to fully integrate Jammu & Kashmir with the rest of India. Curiously, it is following the opposite track in Assam and the Northeast, where more ILP zones will end up ghettoising the region. The Northeast cannot develop this way. Moreover ILP in Assam will likely see similar parochial demands across the country. This is a slippery slope we must avoid at all costs.

        "date": "July 7, 2020, 8:36 PM  IST",
        "article": "Haryana emerged as one of India’s economic success stories this century, driven largely by the emergence of the Gurgaon-Manesar belt as an economic dynamo. On Monday, however, the state’s BJP-led coalition government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar turned the clock back, by deciding to promulgate an ordinance to reserve 75% of fresh private sector jobs for locals. It’s a self-destructive move. Haryana’s recent economic dynamism owes much to its ability to attract talent from across the country. Erecting barriers to labour mobility will deter investment and creation of jobs.The outline of the proposed ordinance indicates it will apply to jobs with a monthly pay below Rs 50,000 and firms that employ more than 10 people. Based on India’s experience with similar byzantine laws, it will likely facilitate corruption and create another barrier to ease of doing business. Moreover, using a populist tool such as 75% reservation is really an admission of government failure. Inability to skill youth adequately is sought to be overcome through self-defeating policies.It’s indefensible for state governments to be invested in GST, which was all about dismantling fiscal barriers, then put up obstacles to labour mobility. Given that Haryana has a BJP CM, it’s also inconsistent with the party’s stand on hollowing out Article 370 which gave residents of erstwhile J&K special privileges. Erecting barriers to labour mobility by states like Haryana and Andhra Pradesh undermines national unity. It’s not too late to step back. Job reservation for locals will not enhance their economic opportunities. Raising the standard of education and skilling youth entering the job market is the only durable way to increase the size of the economic pie.

The most prominent among the leaders of the new outfit are former deputy CM Muzaffar Hussain Baug, former finance minister Altaf Bukhari and former Congress minister Usman Majid.There is no doubt that the nullification of Article 370 has hurt both NC and PDP. The challenge for the new outfit is to ensure that its demand for restoration of statehood is accepted. It doesn’t want further delays in the panchayat polls to capitalise on the public sentiment and also to maximise gains at the grassroots with NC, PDP and Congress undecided about fighting the polls.However, Centre must ensure participation of all political parties. Release of leaders in detention, restoring full internet connectivity and spelling out a clear roadmap for restoration of statehood will woo them back. Their return to the political process would be a vindication of Centre’s anti-Article 370 stance too.

Cross-border firing last year broke all records since the last 18 years, causing much distress to populations living along the LoC and the international border in Jammu & Kashmir. In fact, ceasefire violations from Pakistan had started spiking in 2019 after the Balakot surgical strike by India and New Delhi’s nullification of Article 370 vis-a-vis Kashmir.

        "date": "August 7, 2019, 8:06 PM  IST",
        "article": "The issue of nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution has exposed divides within Congress. Rattled by the government’s move to revoke special status for Jammu & Kashmir, Congress has found it difficult to formulate a coherent position. While senior party leaders like P Chidambaram and Ghulam Nabi Azad attacked government for the move, other Congressmen saw nothing wrong in going along with the treasury benches in Parliament. Embarrassingly, Congress’s chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Bhubaneswar Kalita quit in protest over the party’s position against undoing of Article 370.Further, gen-next Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia and Deepender Hooda gave their thumbs up to the government move. This was after Rahul Gandhi tweeted against Article 370’s cessation saying that national integration couldn’t be furthered by unilaterally tearing apart J&K. True, the Congress Working Committee finally adopted a resolution condemning the nullification of Article 370 without consulting the people of Kashmir. But a clear divide between older and younger Congressmen on the issue has become apparent. After all, the older generation of Congress leaders still adhere to the Nehru-Gandhi legacy of which Article 370 is a part. And that legacy is congruent with the Gandhi family’s centrality within Congress.However, the younger Congress leaders realise that circumstances have changed dramatically and it is no longer possible to treat the Nehruvian legacy as sacrosanct. Given the party’s two back-to-back Lok Sabha drubbings, they feel there is a need to reorient Congress’s position on issues where it needs to think quickly on its feet. In that sense, Congress’s dilemma on Article 370 reflects the party’s leadership struggle at the moment. Should the party continue to look to the Gandhis for leadership or should it initiate a search outside the Congress first family?But every crisis also presents an opportunity. The Article 370 debate could be the inflection point for Congress where a significant number of party leaders choose to come out of the shadow of the Nehru-Gandhi legacy. This in turn could start a much-needed reform of Congress’s internal structures with partymen more attuned to public perceptions rising through the party ranks. Besides, BJP has shown that winning Hindi heartland states is crucial to coming to power at the Centre. If Congress is to revive its political fortunes, it can’t ignore this reality. A tough road lies ahead and the party needs fresh thinking from fresh leaders.568 days ago The then Congress legacy was to have this article on a temporary basis until the population in the state gets settled. Later the local politicians had a taste of free money with no questions asked and resisted the repeal of the article and faced imprisonment also by then Congress rulers! The Congress lost the power to repeal the article as the successive leaders could not overrule the Kashmir politicians, especially the three families / dynasties. The present day Congress politicians, who want actions in the best interests of the country supported the repeal of the article whereas the others merely followed the earlier status adopted by their ineffective leaders!

        "date": "November 21, 2014, 9:35 AM  IST",
        "article": "TIMES VIEWNo case to abrogate 370by Sanjiv ShankaranAs BJP makes a go of Jammu & Kashmir polls, it is debating whether to drop its hardline stance that calls for abrogating Article 370. Guaranteeing the state’s unique status, 370 came out of its messy integration following independence. There is no case to abrogate it as it confirms a special status J&K enjoys in India.J&K is not the only state to enjoy special status. The Constitution’s Article 371 provides special status in earmarked spheres to a number of other states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Nagaland, among others. Special status does not, in itself, alienate any state. In a manner similar to J&K, other states such as Uttarakhand restrict purchase of property by people outside the state. Moreover, hill states in India get fiscal benefits from the central government that are denied to a much poorer state like Bihar. %Differentiated treatment based on unique features is how India is structured.The obsession with Article 370 is misplaced. At one level, it has been weakened on account of the extension of some central laws to J&K. On the other hand, it is difficult to see how the state could be better off without an institution such as Reserve Bank of India. Despite the complications, there is no case to abrogate Article 370.COUNTERVIEW It has outlived its utilityby Chandan NandyArguably the most contentious provision of the Constitution, Article 370, accorded special status to J&K where, except for matters of defence, foreign affairs, finance and communications, laws passed by Parliament are not applicable. While this in itself is anachronistic within India’s federal system, there are valid grounds for its repeal especially in the light of the fact that it was a temporary provision which has long outlived its utility.What justifies abrogation of Article 370 is that J&K operates under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership or property and fundamental rights. For example, Indian citizens from other states cannot purchase land or property in J&K. Women who marry outside the state lose their rights over property, and so do their children.These provisions alienate J&K from the rest of India. Radical separateness will manifest in separatism. The existence of 370 couldn’t insulate the state from a violent separatist insurgency. Its biggest anomaly is while civilians from the rest of India cannot easily settle or do business in the state, the government nevertheless has to flood it with soldiers%to contain insurgency and terror attacks.

        "article": "The eight-phase district development council polls in Jammu & Kashmir have seen the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration – a conglomerate of seven parties including NC and PDP – gain a majority. At the time of going to press, the alliance has won or is leading in 110 out of the 280 seats spread across 20 districts. This means the alliance will have control of nine councils, all in the Kashmir Valley. However, BJP has emerged as the single largest party by winning or leading in at least 75 seats. This gives the party control of six councils in the Jammu region. Plus, the party has won three seats in Kashmir in a symbolic crossing of the Pir Panjal range.Additionally, the Congress and NC are likely to win control of four councils in Jammu, while independents are picking up 50 seats. The results suggest that the polls – the first since the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution last year that revoked J&K’s special status – were successful. The turnout was a substantial 51%. And no party has claimed widespread fraud or rigging. On the contrary, both the Gupkar alliance and BJP have claimed victory. And the fact that independents could play a key role in many of the councils means that the people of J&K could be tiring of the bipolar politics of BJP and Article 370-centric Kashmiri parties.That said, the district development council polls should be seen as a stepping stone towards normalisation in J&K. The security deployment in the region since last year, though necessary given the undiminished threat of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan as well as the new threat from China, cannot be a substitute for development and winning the hearts and minds of the people. In this regard, the district development councils are supposed to drive development through direct funding from the Centre. Therefore, adequate resources should be devolved to the councils to meaningfully empower them.The successful polls also make a case for easing restrictions in J&K. In particular, curbs should be lifted on high speed mobile internet connectivity. With so much of our lives online today due to the Covid-19 pandemic, such internet restrictions create hardships for students, businesses and the tourism sector. They also slow down pandemic control measures. Bringing J&K fully online should follow quickly upon the heels of the successful conduct of elections.64 days ago This is a good beginning to bring J&K to main stream.

        "article": "In a big success for security forces in Kashmir, Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo was killed along with an aide in a five-hour gunbattle in Pulwama district. Naikoo was eliminated just days after the Handwara encounter in which eight security personnel including Colonel Ashutosh Sharma perished in action. Naikoo was on the run for eight years and carried a reward of Rs 12 lakh on his head. Therefore, his neutralisation will certainly be a blow to militancy in Kashmir. <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-136890\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naikoo-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naikoo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naikoo-52x39.jpg 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Naikoo.jpg 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">That said, Naikoo’s encounter and other firefights with terrorists in recent weeks show that militancy continues to plague Kashmir. The scrapping of special status for J&K last year was indeed India’s internal matter. But given the long-term objectives of the terrorists and their sponsors in Pakistan, the nullification of Article 370 is likely being used by militants to spread their anti-India propaganda. This is precisely why New Delhi needs to redouble its efforts to win hearts and minds in Kashmir, especially among Kashmiri youths.In other words, the hard approach towards terrorists needs to be complemented by a soft approach towards Kashmiri youths, to win the battle against militancy in Kashmir. Read also: Who is Riyaz Naikoo: Security forces gun down Hizbul commander295 days ago The stupid people authoring such articles and those commenting havenâ  t a clue how bullets fly when these cowards hide behind civilians.

The announcement came within hours of the chief electoral officer meeting functionaries of four political parties to address their concerns. Barring BJP, the parties reportedly set two conditions for their participation in the bypolls – that polling be on non-party basis and the administration release all their functionaries who have been in detention since August 5 last year. That the administration is unable to conduct panchayat bypolls even six months after special status for J&K was revoked, shows that all is not well.In fact, restrictions on communications in Kashmir continue with the administration not easing speed restrictions on mobile data. Only 2G mobile data service and approved fixed line internet connectivity are available. Plus, internet service providers have been ordered to ensure access only to 1,485 whitelisted sites and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private network applications. The fear is that such social media platforms will be used to incite public disorder. All these restrictions have hampered normal life in Kashmir affecting business, education and routine transactions. The nullification of Article 370 was meant to better integrate Kashmir with the rest of India. But the restrictions that have followed, including the mass detention of political activists, are preventing Kashmiris from normal conduct of their daily lives.Government may have been right in imposing the restrictions in the immediate aftermath of nullification of Article 370. But having convinced the international community that the move was India’s internal matter, there is no justification for continuing harsh restrictions. The next step would be to genuinely reach out to Kashmiris and win over their hearts and minds. Restrictions have gone on for too long, and Kashmir now needs a healing touch.372 days ago The government should take its time to lift restrictions and do it when it deems appropriate.

Politicians in Kashmir are adding to the chaos by threatening serious consequences and violence if the Centre withdraws special status to the state.While their threats are condemnable, all the panic, chaos and confusion created by the Centre is unhealthy and unnecessary. It is important to be transparent and accountable in a democracy so that the trust of the people in the government remains intact.

The troops had been deployed in the erstwhile state before August 5 last year, when the central government had nullified Article 370 of the Constitution that gave J&K special status. In all at least 40,000 additional troops were deployed to J&K before the Article 370 nullification move, to thwart any major instances of violence engendered by the revocation of statehood and special status.But a year on, things have pretty much settled down in J&K. True, terror attacks are still taking place in the valley. But their intensity and scale have come down. Besides, the additional troop deployment was never geared towards completely eliminating terrorism in J&K which requires a sophisticated, multi-dimensional approach.

        "article": "Recently released from his seven-month detention, partly under the Public Safety Act, former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah has now asked for bringing back all J&K detainees who remain in jails outside the Union territory. It will be recalled that more than 5,000 people were detained after the nullification of Article 370 on August 5 last year. This was done with a view to maintaining peace in J&K after the revocation of its special status. True, like Abdullah, many detainees have been released since. But hundreds continue to be detained in jails outside J&K.In fact, the matter was also raised by a delegation of the newly formed Apni Party from J&K in its meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. The latter assured the delegation that political prisoners would be “freed in time to come” based on ground realities. But since Kashmir has been relatively peaceful and government has already managed to largely convince the international community that nullification of Article 370 was India’s internal matter, this is the best time to release political detainees. The message has gone home that Article 370 was a temporary provision of the Indian Constitution, which will not be restored under any circumstances. Now, for normalisation to return there has to be political reconciliation, even as political actors focus their energy on restoring statehood for J&K.New Delhi has repeatedly said that it wants to accelerate J&K’s development and bring large investments to the region. Putting off political reconciliation now will foster greater alienation, which could trigger a vicious cycle and make the job more difficult later.

        "date": "August 6, 2020, 11:04 PM  IST",
        "article": "In an occasion marked by great pomp and religiosity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the cynosure of all eyes at the Ram Mandir bhoomi pujan ceremony. The soaring oratory he brought to the moment was equally a triumph for BJP too. The scene certainly gladdened the hearts of many across the country. But many will also be wondering about its deeper meaning.For the BJP faithful, the August 5 date will have a certain ‘beautiful symmetry’. It’s when BJP came good on two of its major campaign promises: The nullification of J&K’s Article 370, and establishment of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. Hopefully, BJP and Sangh Parivar will now settle down and have less reason to play the ‘Hindu victim’ card.Thanks in no small measure to Modi and BJP’s rhetoric, 21st century India is increasingly aspirational. In that respect, while the PM’s desire for August 5 to gain a greater salience over the Indian psyche is understandable, his conflation of the mandir struggle with India’s freedom movement may be seen by many as overstated. No occasion since August 15, 1947, has measured up as a close seminal event in Indian history – except perhaps the adoption of the Indian Constitution on November 26, 1949, which forms the foundation of the Indian republic today.The government should use this occasion to rededicate itself to keeping India’s tryst with destiny and fulfilling the unrealised goals of the republic. It should apply itself with vigour to reviving the economy, improving governance, and reversing the decades-long underinvestment in public health that the Covid pandemic has so starkly exposed. Aggression by China and fresh claims by Pakistan and even Nepal on our territory is another challenge that needs to be tackled. Temples and other monuments can contribute to great cultural signification and gratification, but they cannot replace improving the quality of people’s lives and boosting national well-being, which is the real deal. That’s what the government must now focus its mind and energies on. In his speech, Modi invoked nationalist spirit and described Ram as a symbol of inclusive governance and popular welfare. He should harness his popularity to ensure that the NDA’s record of governance approximates to the ideals he celebrated at Ayodhya.203 days ago Same old lecturing. Hindu victimization is a reality in India. It is not a card as the editors trivialize it. India was divided to create a separate homeland for Muslims and a vast amount of land was given away for that reason. A big chunk of Muslims stayed back - nothing wrong with that. However, the Hindus have been subdued so that they cannot freely practice their religion or enjoy/reclaim their heritage that was destroyed by the Muslims and the British. Why? They had to fight for decades even to reclaim the Janmabhumi of Ram (everyone knows, even after state sponsored denials, that Babri mosque was built on a temple). Lakhs of Hindus have been kicked out of their homeland in Kashmir. Is that a card? Huge swaths of land has been claimed as Waqf property. Why? Wasn't Pakistan (including Bangladesh) created for that? In some parts of West Bengal, Hindus are not allowed to practice their religion? Only Hindu temples are controlled by the state but not mosques or churches. However, Imams and Maulvis of mosques are paid salaries from the taxes collected from all citizens in WB and Delhi etc. Why? This list is too long and bothersome. The Hindus have to defend their religion, their rights, their heritage, and everything associated with Hinduism all the time and that too in their homeland, India. Jokers like the editors cannot fathom the importance of Shri Ram Janmabhumi temple. It is not only the place of worship but also a symbol of Hindu heritage that they have reclaimed very much like how one achieves independence (as PM Modi said so well) after centuries (or decades post 1947) of struggle and sacrifice. The Hindus have been able to unshackle themselves, finally! Those bred in Congress/Nehru teachings and slavery are not likely to understand or appreciate that. Managing Covid-19 has been a huge challenge especially for an over-populated country like India. Our PM's deft handling, early on, saved lakhs of Indian lives. The pandemic is still going on, but the Ram Janmabhum shilanayas  event has brought a lot of joy and hope, and will energize many Indians as we all deal with the challenges. Jai Shri Ram!...

        "headline": "Changing the game in Kashmir: In nullifying Article 370 and bifurcating state, government has redrawn strategic calculus",
        "date": "August 5, 2019, 8:03 PM  IST",
        "article": "In a momentous decision, government moved Parliament yesterday to abate Article 370 of the Constitution and supersede Article 35A, thereby effectively ceasing the special status for Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill to bifurcate the state and create two separate Union territories – Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without a legislature. This means that the Constitution of India shall now apply in full force across J&K and Ladakh, and the J&K legislature will henceforth not have any discretionary powers to decide who permanent residents of the territory are or provide them with special rights with respect to employment and acquisition of property.Abrogating Article 370 has been a long-held wish of BJP which sees the provision as a historical wrong. However, the complicated history of Kashmir and the sensitivity surrounding the matter had hitherto prevented such a move. But with the current BJP government projecting muscular nationalism and enjoying significant numerical strength in Parliament, cessation of Article 370 became more doable. Given that abrogating Article 370 was part of the BJP manifesto, on the basis of which it swept Lok Sabha polls, the government has the mandate to do this. That non-NDA parties like BSP, AAP, YSRCP, BJD and AIADMK too have come out in support of the government’s move shows which way the winds are blowing.Arguably, Article 370 had contributed to the problems in Kashmir. The state’s special powers of autonomy meant in practice arrogation of power by a tiny Valley elite, which led to a feeling of not being represented among the people of Jammu and Ladakh, as well as disaffection feeding into separatist sentiment in the Valley itself. And given that Kashmir came to be a troubled state with separatist sentiments being stoked by Pakistan with the help of cross-border terrorism, this may have been the worst of both worlds. Besides, Article 370 was meant to be a temporary provision. In that sense its cessation now is congruent with historical constitutional perspective.That said, there are some issues with the way in which Article 370 is being nullified and the state bifurcated. Even according to the constitutional provision to abate Article 370, consultation with the J&K state assembly is deemed necessary before a constitutional order to this effect is passed. The government, however, has chosen to use the fact that there is no J&K government at the moment and substituted the latter with the J&K governor. While this approach may or may not be legally valid, it certainly bypasses wider discussion on the matter that would have been democratically sound.Second, the logic behind converting the state into two Union territories is also not plain. True, there has been a demand for Union territory status in Ladakh for some time. But with the cessation of Article 370, the special powers accruing to the J&K assembly in Srinagar would also extinguish. Thus, it is debatable if bifurcation of the state and creation of the Union territory of Ladakh was necessary after that.In fact, this would be the first time in the history of India that a state was being converted into Union territories – the trend has been the other way around. Hence, given the magnitude of the decision, more all-round discussion would have been prudent. But perhaps government’s decision to push ahead with its Article 370 move was linked to external factors. With the US looking to wind down its military engagement in Afghanistan and turning to Pakistan to facilitate a peace deal with Afghan Taliban, Islamabad has been upping the ante on Kashmir.New Delhi perhaps felt that Islamabad was gaining too much leverage in the emerging regional scenario and had to do something to counter this. Whatever the compulsions, even if Article 370 is abrogated New Delhi will have to – sooner rather than later – grant full statehood rights to Jammu & Kashmir and perhaps Ladakh too, for the sake of democratic governance as well as the federal principles in which India is grounded.570 days ago Long standing historical blunder  of Pt Nehru  has been  righted.

        "article": "Hearing pleas relating to the nullification of Article 370, accompanied by sweeping restrictions that have now been in place for more than 40 days, the Supreme Court said yesterday that “keeping in mind the national interest and internal security” the J&K state government should “make all endeavours to ensure normal life is restored.”The Centre told the court that if the restrictions had not been put in place “there would have been an extremely volatile situation in the Valley.” Instead “not a single bullet has been fired” in the state since August 5. The restrictions, however, have caused great inconvenience to ordinary citizens. Moreover, two former chief ministers have been under detention since August 5 and now a third is being held under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA). The irony is that 81-year-old Farooq Abdullah is actually a former alliance partner of BJP, three-time chief minister and six-time MP.Another irony is that the law that is now being used against him, where the provision applied allows him to be detained for a period of a year without trial, was passed by his late father Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah in 1978.But the larger import is that restoration of normalcy is unlikely in the near term. However, such restrictions in a democracy look terrible, and the government must work hard to restore normalcy as soon as possible.528 days ago It is a very difficult situation especially when many of the local politicians are pakistani agents and are silently working to destabilize the area.

        "article": "Amid a sustained diplomatic onslaught by Pakistan, the Modi government has received a shot in the arm with the main opposition party, Congress, saying it is in complete agreement with government’s position on Pakistan and terror threats emanating from that country. Pakistan has been fruitlessly attempting to highlight a purported slide in India’s respect for human rights and secularism in recent years.This was the moment for India’s political class to unite and send a strong message that India stands together against Pakistan’s mischievous attempts to sow divides. Government can also respond positively to the Congress position by taking the party into confidence on its measures to restore normalcy in Kashmir, an issue on which Congress continues to differ with the government. At this point, only a successful post-Article 370 transition in Kashmir can permanently settle the dispute and end Pakistan’s attempts to stoke violence in the Valley and the rest of India.Governments will come and go but India’s success in defending its position on Kashmir and against Pakistan has primarily rested on political consensus on the issue, focus on economic development, its robust democracy and better track record on human rights than all its Asian neighbours. In comparison, Pakistan fares poorly in all these areas. Unfortunately, in recent times there has been an attempt by our parties to tar each other by claiming their respective positions help Pakistan’s cause.

        "article": "Two months have elapsed since Parliament nullified Article 370 and the Kashmir Valley has largely remained calm amid heavy military deployment and restrictions on movement and communications. Outbreak of violence and consequent loss of lives – of both civilians and security forces – were cited as reasons for the curbs. For people in Jammu & Kashmir it has been a particularly trying time, trapped in their homes and with few avenues to contact the outside world. But the muted response to what was an explosive situation and the success in averting deaths had proved the Centre right.It must now devise ways to restore normalcy. Those attempts appear to have begun this week with the invitation to tourists to return and the visit of the National Conference delegation to detained former chief ministers Farooq and Omar Abdullah. However, tourists will return only when they are assured of their safety and mobile connectivity is restored. Perhaps the government can first open up voice calls and then 2G data before allowing faster mobile internet like 3G and 4G.Continuing the restrictions longer also runs the risk of hardening Kashmiri sentiments. The detention of political activists creates a vacuum where militants will step in. Politicians and civil society leaders need to be released forthwith if legitimate political activity is to resume. Many Kashmiris accept that Article 370 was nothing more than a symbolic provision that accorded no real autonomy amid heavy military presence over the past three decades. The promise to restore statehood when the security situation improves is key to mainstream political parties regaining lost ground. There is no room for triumphalism. The international community is watching and Kashmir’s harmonious return to the mainstream from this critical juncture will be the actual political victory, not the nullification of 370 and 35A.505 days ago Otherwise India is loosing its reputation globally        This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.

        "article": "The visit of 27 European parliamentarians to Jammu & Kashmir reveals a determined government push to mould international opinion on its attempts to restore normalcy after Article 370 was nullified. This is well and good. Pakistan is on a diplomatic offensive telling a tale of great “atrocities” and “human rights violations” in Kashmir; this needs to be countered. One reason why the Kashmir problem has festered for so long is that Pakistan has so often diplomatically outmanoeuvred India on the international stage even as it conducts a ruthless proxy war in Kashmir – because New Delhi has not told its side of the story well. This must change. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign minister S Jaishankar had highlighted India’s contention that Article 370 was not a permanent measure and that subsequent security arrangements were necessary to prevent terrorists from unleashing violence. That’s a decent start.It’s also important that New Delhi creates enough facts on the ground to complement its story. Allowing more delegations to visit J&K will convince the international community that India’s sole interest remains in normalising the situation, even as it confronts a tough security predicament with the killing of truckers ferrying apples, grenade attacks on civilians and LoC infiltration attempts. With the Block Development Council elections concluded successfully, government mustn’t delay the release of political detainees.If New Delhi has run into tough criticism lately – notably, a recent US Congressional hearing on human rights in South Asia focussed almost exclusively on Kashmir – it could also be due to developments elsewhere in India which belie its democratic and secular image. Those developments in turn could feed into Kashmir’s unrest as well. A clear articulation of secular values which will not succumb to fundamentalism can convince all nations that India’s fight is no different from theirs, as well as win hearts and minds in Kashmir. From the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits onwards, India has taken hard knocks from Pakistan-backed terrorists with extreme Islamist ideologies. But successive governments were hesitant to call out the religious motivations internationally.The Modi government has greater clarity on India’s war on terror and strategic interest in Kashmir. But its hardline Hindutva agenda on non-issues such as NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill are squandering goodwill as well as hard-earned brownie points over Islamabad. The government must instead focus on putting Kashmir back on its feet and telling India’s story better, while reversing sectarian moves elsewhere.485 days ago NRC and Citizenship amendment bill are definitely not non issues.

        "article": "A massive detention centre that can house 3,000 detainees is under construction and Assam is preparing to build ten more such centres, amidst utter confusion over the fates of 19 lakh people excluded from the National Register of Citizens. The seeds of a humanitarian disaster have been sown with many of those excluded claiming to be citizens with documents to prove their case. The mess in Assam notwithstanding, the NRC idea is catching on elsewhere with no thought for document deficient citizens, especially the poor, among us.On Tuesday, Union home minister Amit Shah promised an NRC in Bengal. “India for Indians” is a legitimate nationalist slogan. But differing interpretations of who is local and non-local in a document-poor society make attempts to flesh out this theoretical nationalism through exercises such as NRC impractical. Moreover, BJP’s undisguised appeal to non-Muslims promising to cover them through the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) before NRC is implemented has stoked opposition in Assam and other north-east states. Too many states have witnessed regional, linguistic, religious and ethnic chauvinism in the past and all these could just flare up again.The combination of a religion based CAB and a bureaucratic, arbitrary and error-prone NRC violates basic constitutional rights like equality before law (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion (Article 15). Alongside such constitutional violations is the failure to articulate a roadmap for NRC and what becomes of those who lose out. Will they be released after serving a jail term and naturalised, or does the government propose to lock them up and throw away the key? Leaving the specifics for later is a sure recipe for social strife.In the past too India has paid a heavy price when governments lunged into political minefields unmindful of unintended consequences. Congress’s desire to undercut the Akalis by propping up Bhindranwale is a prime example. Following the abrogation of Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign minister S Jaishankar did an excellent job of promoting India’s narrative on Kashmir internationally. Nevertheless, Pakistan is on a propaganda offensive that attempts to portray India as biased against Muslims. If NRC is now accompanied by mega detention camps holding primarily Muslims, accompanied by large-scale internal migration, states walling off borders against non-locals, and communal discord – it will not only be a domestic catastrophe, the government would have undermined Modi’s and Jaishankar’s valuable work abroad and handed Pakistan an undeserved propaganda victory.511 days ago The only major source of â   illegal migrants â   is Bangladesh. Its Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, one of Indiaâ  s few remaining friends in South Asia, is here on an official visit, plans to raise the issue of NRC with her hosts. The repeated assurances given to her government that there will be no deportations have failed to quell disquiet in a country that has an active anti India grouping. 2. If the assurances given to her are trustworthy, it knocks the stuffing out of the proposed exercise. If no one is going nowhere, why put people, predominantly Muslims, through this trauma. It will add to their existing sense of fear and insecurity, add to social tensions. 3. Prince MbS has promised to invest $ 100 billion in the Indian economy. Millions of Indians earn their daily bread in Muslim majority countries. Indian diplomats over generations have forged strong bilateral relationships with Muslim countries, notwithstanding our issues with Pakistan and Kashmir. A lot is at stake. It is time for MEA to sensitise the political executive to the perils that lie ahead. 4. As far as the Indian narrative on Kashmir and the worldâ  s acceptance of it is concerned, it is still a work in progress. It is contingent on how things pan out once restrictions are lifted.

        "article": "Given security considerations in terror-struck Kashmir, the Centre may have been justified in imposing curbs after the abrogation of special status for Jammu & Kashmir. But four months on, extreme restrictions need to go. These are only creating hardships for locals and undermining the government’s pitch that Article 370 was nullified to usher in development. Nor is it wise to argue that restrictions will be fully lifted once the situation completely normalises. For, that could take even years. Continuing with restrictions on mobility and other freedoms in the meantime will only make people bitter. In that sense, the restrictions themselves come in the way of normalisation.Besides, government has already achieved its objective in that the international community has largely accepted that nullifying Article 370 was India’s internal matter. The next step is to win the hearts and minds of the people of Kashmir and usher in real development. This isn’t possible if restrictions continue and political leadership remains in detention. Too much of a hard approach could be counterproductive and play into the hands of militants.As a side benefit lifting of curbs would also make the task of Indian diplomacy easier, as it battles to counter Pakistani propaganda. European Union’s ambassador to India, Ugo Astuto, has added to growing international clamour for normalcy, saying New Delhi must take steps to restore rights and freedoms of the people. True, mobile phones in Kashmir buzzed back to life after a gap of 72 days on October 14. But it is only now that SMS-based one-time-password services have resumed for business transactions.

The almost immediate escalation of cross-border firing indicates that Pakistan was just waiting for the FATF meeting to culminate before resuming overtly hostile actions targeting India. The Indian response through artillery fire directed at terror infrastructure in Pakistan is appropriate in this scenario. Pakistan isn’t going to be deterred by restraint on India’s part and the Modi government realised this quite early in its first tenure.Yet the difficulty for India is that Pakistan, despite a bloody nose on several such occasions, refuses to let go of its obsession with hurting India. Since the revocation of Article 370 in August signifying the end of the Valley’s symbolic autonomy Islamabad is itching to do something, evident in Prime Minister Imran Khan’s melodramatic invocation of doomsday scenarios before world leaders. Even while its diplomatic push floundered, on a parallel track attempts to push terrorists into Kashmir Valley and stoke violence have proceeded earnestly. And with the FATF reprieve in its bag – at least for now – Islamabad may feel this is the time to pull the trigger.With winter setting in and mountain passes going to close, the cross-border firing may be a last-ditch attempt to provide cover to would-be infiltrators. The need for paramount vigilance at this time cannot be overstated. There are no shades of grey when a country hosts and nurtures terrorists on its soil. It is unfortunate that China, Turkey and Malaysia are doggedly protecting Pakistan in forums like FATF. They are in line for international embarrassment given Pakistan’s unsavoury history as a terror host.493 days ago Without an external enemy to show, propagate, and engage 24/7, pakistan will implode on its own.

Jammu and Kashmir have been under varying degrees of a shutdown since August and there are little signs of progress being made on the political front. A realignment of politicians, earlier loyal to the Abdullahs and Muftis, appears to be in the works but this is taking time and the new formations will have to prove their public standing.On the other hand, negotiating with Omar and Mehbooba, leaders who have shown a great degree of flexibility in the past in aligning with national parties like BJP and Congress shouldn’t be so difficult. With summer just a few months away, when both politics and violence registers an uptick in the Valley, it is important for Centre to seize the upper hand in effecting a political breakthrough.Even if Article 370 is scrapped, Centre should restore J&K’s statehood to send the message that the same principles of federalism that apply to other states will hold true for J&K too. Many in J&K recognise that Article 370 was all but a hollowed-out provision due to the huge military presence in the state. Now Kashmiri politicians must demand that full statehood be immediately restored. This could become the starting point for sparing the people the immense economic hardship that has visited the state since August.Read full story: After 6 months’ detention, Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti booked under Public Safety Act385 days ago 30 years of exile of Kashmiri Pandits is violative of their rights and the media was silent then and silent now!

        "article": "The ongoing seat sharing talks between BJP and Shiv Sena appear to be reaching a bend in the road with BJP pushing for contesting a majority of the seats. Such an outcome will formalise the changed political situation in Maharashtra since the 2014 assembly polls when BJP stunned Shiv Sena, till then the senior partner, by winning 122 seats against the latter’s 63. Needing 144 seats to stay in government, both parties have endured an uneasy relationship with Sena constantly sniping at BJP. Rancour gave way to pragmatism when Lok Sabha elections approached and an alliance was quickly stitched up allowing NDA to walk away with 41 of 48 Maharashtra seats earlier this year.The big question is whether the same good sense will again prevail among the two partners who first bonded over Hindutva. The stakes are higher for Shiv Sena as its primary “Marathi manoos” identity keeps losing steam against BJP’s Hindu nationalistic political pitch. BJP is eyeing gains from its muscular positions on Article 370 and Pakistan and the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP is also helped by its chief minister Devendra Fadnavis earning a reputation for deftly handling political minefields like Maratha reservation and farm distress while eschewing hardline Hindutva positions, unlike many of his party colleagues.Not content to rest on its own organisational strengths, BJP has also unveiled a strategy of wooing over popular leaders and strongmen from NCP and Congress. NCP, which has been pushing for a 50:50 division of seats with a “leaderless” state Congress, will be more worried by the unending exodus from its own ranks. With a narrow leadership base that mostly draws influence from sugar cooperatives, those at the helm of Congress and NCP have been ineffective in holding the government to account for dwindling farm incomes, recurrent droughts and now flooding.In the absence of a credible opposition, the likes of Prakash Ambedkar riding on a “vanchit bahujan” identity encompassing Dalits, Muslims and other deprived groups have been emboldened to set forbidding terms for an alliance with Congress-NCP. Yet, given the economic slump, there is no room for BJP to be complacent despite its success in eating into voteshares of the three other big parties. Winning Maharashtra, India’s second largest state by population and largest by GDP, is important for all sides.

        "article": "With the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens moving the authorities to shut down the internet in different parts of the country, India’s dubious distinction as a world leader in blocking internet services has come to the fore. In fact, last week the national capital saw its first such curb on information flow, marking the 95th time this year that authorities had blocked the internet. Since 2012, government has suspended internet services 367 times and in 2018, 67% of the world’s internet shutdowns were in India. Add to this the ongoing internet shutdown in Kashmir crossing 140 days, the longest ever in a democracy.Embarrassingly, India’s frequent internet shutdowns have been praised by communist China to justify its own restrictive internet practices. All of this seriously undermines India’s commitment to a democratic or modern society. After all, the internet today is akin to electricity in earlier decades. It is fundamental to modern life and economy. Frequent shutdowns also undermine the government’s Digital India dreams. At a time when other nations are moving to 5G mobile technology to advance digital economies, India’s curbs are antediluvian.True, there could be extraordinary law and order instances where temporary internet curbs may be imposed. But such shutdowns can’t become the order of the day, nor should they flow from knee-jerk reactions on the part of authorities. The curbs make commerce extremely difficult and diminish India’s attractiveness to investment, whether foreign or domestic. The lockdown in Kashmir following nullification of Article 370 has reportedly cost the local economy more than $2.4 billion. The internet shutdown has contributed to this. Therefore, government would do well to recognise the enormous costs of curbing internet access. Other democracies prioritise security too, but they don’t do it at the cost of the internet or by suspending mobile phone services.431 days ago Why only dream of digital India.ALL DREAMS OF VIKAS HAS BEEN DESTRYED BY ONE MAN,FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO HIM.We will soon be travelling in bullock carts.

Many Kashmiri politicians and activists – including former chief ministers – remain in detention. Meanwhile, a fresh spate of terrorist attacks against non-Kashmiris and ‘outsiders’ has begun, as exemplified by the recent killing of five labourers from Bengal.The Centre should utilise the closing of Kashmir’s passes in winter, which deters infiltration from across the LoC, to normalise its security situation as soon as possible. Simultaneously, it’s best to recognise there exists a great deal of disaffection in the Valley, and many took the nullification of Article 370 and scrapping of statehood as an insult. Militancy cannot be addressed unless Kashmiris are assuaged. For this, Kashmir’s political space needs to be opened up and issues worked through – no matter how bitter and contentious – even as the government makes it clear that violence and terrorism are not acceptable. Disaffection in Kashmir and Pakistan sponsored militancy are related but independent variables. While the latter has to be neutralised, the government must also work hard to win the hearts and minds of Kashmiris. A two-pronged approach is thus needed.For the same reason the government should welcome foreign delegations and be confident enough to handle questions from them, even if they are tough. Such visits are essential to counter the propaganda offensive unleashed by Pakistan and give the world a sense of Kashmir’s ground reality. In this regard the recent visit of a 23-member delegation of European Union lawmakers, while a welcome first step, has come under criticism because many of the delegates were from far-right parties. New Delhi should therefore look to enable visits from more diverse foreign delegations in the future.The government has clearly indicated that there is no going back on the nullification of Article 370, marked as a temporary provision in India’s Constitution. But Union home minister Amit Shah has said that it wouldn’t take long to restore J&K statehood once normalcy returns. New Delhi should walk this talk and leave no stone unturned, to restore normalcy and make J&K a state again.483 days ago New Delhi should do this. New Delhi should do that ... It is high time this narrative is abandoned for good. The Indian government is doing its best to provide a secure environment to J&K. It has jailed the trouble makers and has provided additional security forces. It is up tp the people of J&K especially Kashmir to respond in a sensible manner. They must go about doing their things normally.  The more normal they behave, the faster would normalcy be restored. The Kashmiris killed, raped, and threw out lakhs for Kashmiri Pandits from their homes. Why should their feelings be hurt? The Kashmiri's have been living on the largesse of India's tax payer money - still hurt feelings? The media, the Kashmiris, and everyone else should get normal! Lastly, why should India invite leftists to visit Kashmir? What would one expect from them? More lies, more falsification? We already have enough of that without them having any real knowledge of the valley....  Read More          This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.

        "date": "September 29, 2019, 7:18 PM  IST",
        "article": "While Prime Minister Imran Khan, as expected, used his turn at the UN General Assembly lectern to launch into an apoplectic tirade against India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did well to stay out of the mud wrestling pit with Khan. Modi didn’t make a single reference to Pakistan in his speech – instead making a broad appeal to fight the scourge of terror and focussing on issues such as climate change, renewable energy and poverty alleviation.It’s best to let Khan speak for himself on such matters – his habitual resort to nuclear sabre rattling will only showcase the vast gap between the sense of responsibility a nuclear power ought to exhibit and Pakistan’s actual behaviour. The duplicities in his argument are fairly obvious to the world community; one of them was indicated by Alice Wells, the US state department’s point person for the region, that Pakistan stays mum when it comes to Uighur Muslims in China, whose fate is certainly far worse than that of Kashmiri Muslims in India – Uighurs are disallowed from practising their religion and hundreds of thousands of them have been herded into concentration camp-like conditions. A look at the state of minorities or of democracy in Pakistan itself would also be salutary.As Pakistan’s dramatically opposed stances on India and China demonstrate, they stem not so much from concern about the state of Muslims or of human rights as from Pakistan’s own pre-existing orientations towards those nations. Khan’s hypocritical rhetoric isn’t finding much traction outside his country, as he himself has sadly noted. To get out of the impasse where it finds itself lodged, Pakistan must re-examine its attitude of primal antipathy towards India. There’s everything to be gained from leveraging a booming India, and much to be lost from pursuing the impossible dream of strategic parity with India in all respects.On New Delhi’s part, it must begin to lift restrictions in Kashmir and create conditions to hold elections. It needs to strike a balance between fighting terror and reaching out to the Kashmiri people. After all, normalising the situation in Kashmir and facilitating rapid development there are the best shields against terrorism. New Delhi must now show that in nullifying Article 370, it has laid the foundation for a better future for Kashmiris.514 days ago In short ,finally Truth prevails        This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.

        "article": "After an eventful first term political startup AAP is seeking votes again on the basis of its governance record, while BJP is going all out to unseat it. Until about mid-2017 AAP and BJP constantly baited each other, as a consequence of which governance had suffered since the structure of authority in the national capital is a divided one. Since then chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to have kept his head down, toned down the theatrics and focussed on administration – perhaps out of a realisation that voters will tire of the constant search for enemies and demand results.It’s to his credit that he sees his government’s primary job as delivering on education and health – areas that have been traditionally under-emphasised by India’s political class. BJP, however, has had plenty of opportunity to dissect Kejriwal’s claims and question his purported successes on these and other governance related areas, and it’s a little surprising that the principal opposition party hasn’t made full use of that opportunity. Rather than Kejriwal’s performance BJP has bet big on making the elections a mandate on Shaheen Bagh, even if painting AAP and Shaheen Bagh protesters with the same brush is a bit of a stretch. This has occurred in the midst of hate fuelled shootings, campus violence and gross incompetence in policing.Kejriwal has kept his distance from the protests and placed the onus for resolution on the Centre, with its control over police and traffic. By supporting Article 370 nullification, opposing CAA, and focussing on work done by his government, AAP has staked out a middle ground in the last couple of years. BJP’s campaign, by contrast, places a premium on national security in a local election. This is a novel plank, and it’s anybody’s guess how Delhi’s electorate responds in an assembly election to issues not of local roads, hospitals or plumbing, but of an abstract nationalism that consists of taking on spectral enemies who occasionally morph into the figures of opposition parties and leaders, if not Shaheen Bagh protesters.BJP’s strategy has, for instance, resulted in attempts to characterise Kejriwal as a “terrorist”. Some have seen in the strategy a way of energising its core cadre while getting out the Hindu vote. If this strategy succeeds, it will have ramifications for future elections as well.

Meanwhile, India has also been helped by Pakistan’s poor standing among world nations, especially its terror record. They seem to be seeing through Pakistan’s attempt to stoke unrest in the Valley and China’s vested interest in keeping India pinned down on its western border with Pakistan.Of course, there is no room for complacency. Summer is just a few months away and the uneasy peace in the Valley can give way without more confidence building measures. The Supreme Court order to review internet connectivity suggesting that the least restrictive measures need to be applied can help mollify many Valley residents, especially the youth. Signs of resumption of political activity are evident but the continuing detention of the top leadership of Kashmir’s two big parties–NC and PDP–is holding up faster progress.Convincing the Abdullahs and Muftis to accept the revocation of Article 370 would be a major success for the central government.

        "article": "At the political level it has been a victory of alliance politics, with BJP paying the price for going solo and the JMM-Congress coalition reaping rich returns. After Maharashtra and Haryana, the Jharkhand result also suggests that ‘national’ issues like Article 370 nullification, Ram Mandir construction and CAA-NRC are not bearing fruit for BJP at the state level. Local issues dominate here, and it so happens that many of the hardships being experienced in Jharkhand only echo what’s happening in other states – there is real economic distress. Once the opposition rides to power on the back of the resulting disaffection, it bears responsibility for offering real economic solutions. Where BJP has failed, JMM-Congress has to deliver.Tellingly, not only did BJP stumble in the tribal belt but it also drew a blank in Kolhan, the region that includes the industrial township of Jamshedpur. While the fruits of Jharkhand’s early industrialisation were reaped by “outsiders” the downturn in the mining, steel and thermal power industries in recent years has meant that few new opportunities are being created – redistributing a pie that simply hasn’t been growing has obvious limits. Reforming land acquisition to reinvigorate industry has been thoroughly mishandled. Booking 10,000 Pathalgadi protesters with sedition in just one district, Khunti, has boomeranged. Adivasi resistance to land acquisition has solidified. JMM-Congress will have to find a way through.Reserving 75% private sector jobs for locals as JMM has promised in its manifesto is only going to repel industry. Farm loan waivers are another populist JMM-Congress promise without any growth impact. With low per capita income, just above UP and Bihar, Jharkhand struggles with basics like food and education.  Recall how several starvation deaths were reported here amid criticism over the hasty rollout of PDS-Aadhaar linkage in remote areas. Handouts like toilets and LPG cylinders help but are no replacement for investment in human capital.Listen to the Jharkhand voter’s message. It is an opportunity for BJP to course correct just seven months into the Modi government’s second stint and for opposition to tailor a national narrative around a fresh approach to economic revival. The former’s Hindutva onslaught and the latter’s stale welfarist-populist refrain aren’t helping.

Trending #HumWapasAayenge was an affirmation of their resolve to return, despite successive governments’ failure to facilitate this quest. In the three decades since the Pandits’ ouster opportunities in the Valley have hardly grown to potential, even for the Kashmiri Muslims. What the Valley needs today is a return to normalcy, and then of prosperity. A Kashmir to which the Pandits return will be one where its two communities come together and grow together again.But much work needs to be done to improve social and material conditions that can pave the way for the Pandits’ safe return. Kashmir economy has taken crushing blows since the nullification of Article 370 and the revocation of statehood. The Valley’s tourism industry, apple trade and services sector – all of which were anyway underperforming amid sporadic violence and frequent shutdowns – have virtually ground to a halt. Having prevented violence and mass protests, government must now move quickly to relax controls.Only then can businesses resume and generate employment. Much virtue is being made of mobile 2G services resumption. With the rest of India and the world operating at 4G speeds, the offer of snail-paced 2G is step-motherly treatment at best. The slight from Niti Aayog’s VK Saraswat that internet suspension has made no difference to Kashmir since people used it only to watch “dirty” films cannot be the views of a humane, progressive and business-friendly government. Indeed officials appear to be running out of reasons to deny Kashmiris internet.The Valley sorely misses political direction. Politicians who can offer a vision to shepherd Kashmir in this post 370 phase aren’t emerging. The continued detention of the Abdullahs and Muftis may be preventing their respective parties from taking the lead in forming public opinion. The visits of foreign envoys and Union ministerial delegations are important for pan-India and international perceptions but sustained gains will only materialise with local political participation. On August 5, while introducing the J&K Reorganisation Bill in Rajya Sabha, home minister Amit Shah made several promises, but none more upbeat than a specific exhortation to Kashmiri youth: “Give us five years and we will make Kashmir the most developed state in India.” Delivering that promise will help redeem yesteryear’s injustices.402 days ago While shallow sympathies are expressed with the Pandits, the real intent of the editorial is to repeat the criticism of the government for internet restrictions.

        "article": "The first assembly elections after the Lok Sabha polls will test whether BJP’s incumbent governments in Maharashtra and Haryana pass the popularity test like the Modi government at the Centre. Congress, despite wins in three state polls late last year, which would indicate a greater probability of success against BJP’s state leaders, has struggled to recover from the staggering defeat in May. In that election NDA had a 51.3% vote share in Maharashtra and 58.3% in Haryana, leaving opposition parties a dispirited lot.The BJP-Shiv Sena and Congress-NCP alliances remain the major political forces in Maharashtra but with one significant difference: BJP has surged ahead of the field forcing Shiv Sena to accept a supporting role in their partnership. NCP and Congress, which drew their strength from rural cooperatives, have been hampered by the exodus of key leaders. Congress’s listlessness, with no central or state leader taking on major campaigning responsibilities, has cast the spotlight on Sharad Pawar. But the firepower that BJP has directed at the opposition has few parallels.Nationalism also becomes a perfect foil to general local perception about chief ministers Devendra Fadnavis and ML Khattar as clean and shrewd leaders capable of carrying party, government and influential communities along. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have not shied away from making the two state elections about Article 370 nullification and other maximalist positions on national security like NRC. That Maharashtra and Haryana are far away from Kashmir and Bangladesh hardly matters. Moreover the eve of the election has seen major retaliation against Pakistan’s unprovoked firing on Indian civilian and military facilities on the LoC. This will recall national security concerns for voters.The state of the economy could have been a major counter by the opposition. The longstanding crisis in agriculture and the lack of jobs and quality education could have resonated disenchantment in Maharashtra and Haryana where reservation demands had peaked. But even here the big question is how sharp and relatable the opposition critique is. Once again, electoral politics has failed to properly engage with these pressing issues. The key difference is that the narrative has shifted from cobbling together winning numbers through handouts and social engineering to majoritarian and nationalist rhetoric that cuts through caste and socio-economic divides. The extent of the electorate’s receptiveness to such messaging could see its replay in future assembly polls.494 days ago As usual, one sided, BJP-damning  commentary. When Congress/NCP were in power, lack of economic success was hidden behind those strong co-operative leaders who brought votes in big heards.

Reminder-India is still the fastest growing major economy in the world alongside China. Maharashtra and Haryana(NCR) are one of the biggest beneficiaries of that progress.

On the other hand, the logic for nullification of Article 370 is that autonomy and special status for Kashmir keep separatist hopes alive. That’s something New Delhi wants to take off the table now, rhetorically amplified by the statement that it will now negotiate only on PoK.If this is a maximalist position, it’s a response to Pakistani maximalism that spurns any number of peace initiatives from successive Indian governments as it attempts to wrest J&K by any means possible. And if Islamabad has currently opened up a fusillade on all fronts against New Delhi, including on the LoC, Beijing has moved to provide it diplomatic cover by interceding on its behalf at the UN Security Council.However, the majority of participating UNSC members have concurred, in a closed door meeting, that the issue ought to be resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan. This has been New Delhi’s position throughout since the 1972 Simla Agreement. But China’s bid to influence international opinion in Pakistan’s favour is something that New Delhi must take note of. In particular, China’s talk of human rights violations in Kashmir has to leave one slack jawed, given its severely repressive rule in Tibet and internment of a million Uighurs in Xinjiang in ‘re-education’ camps. New Delhi should not now refrain from criticising Beijing on human rights issues, or using economic levers against China as China habitually does against other countries.It needs to be recognised that apart from principles India’s diplomatic victory over Kashmir was also made possible by its open society and growing economic heft that offers business opportunities. Thus, New Delhi needs to strengthen these assets further and not fall prey to protectionist headwinds and insular mindsets. Policies that undermine economic growth also undermine diplomatic heft. Next, Kashmir needs to be handled sensitively and apprehensions of Kashmiris must be mitigated. It is also necessary to walk back on general minority baiting in the country manifested in much current rhetoric and legislation. More of this will only lower India’s international reputation and standing, inhibit Kashmir’s integration with the rest of the country, and lend to Pakistani propaganda a semblance of credibility.556 days ago 1. I think it is necessary that we are clear about NDA governmentâ  s all time priorities. Doing away with Kashmirâ  s special status provisions was always on the agenda of BJP and PM Narendra Modi has chosen an appropriate time to do that. 2. It is a fact that NDA governmentâ  s decision as regards abrogation of Articles 35A and 370 have lead to protests from a section of citizens of the Kashmir valley. All citizen-voters wish that normalcy returns to the valley at the earliest. They also know that prevailing tense situation in the valley is not good for return of normalcy in ordinary Kashmirisâ   life. 3. But let us also accept that we cannot move forward until atmosphere conducive for return of normalcy exists in the Kashmir valley. I think for creating atmosphere of mutual trust, it is time all politicians of the Kashmir valley, including Hurriyat Conference leaders, accept two ground realities: (a) Kashmir is, and will forever remain, part of the Indian Union. (b) NDA govt. will never discuss the Kashmir issue with either separatists or with Pakistan. 4. Is it not true that time is running out for these politicians? They must decide either to support NDA government so that terrorism is wiped out from the valley or to join those anti-national groups who provide support to Pakistan trained terrorists and get marginalized at the hands of these terrorists....

        "date": "September 9, 2019, 8:02 PM  IST",
        "article": "After months of speculation, the Afghan peace talks are off. US President Donald Trump reportedly took the decision after Taliban claimed responsibility for a recent attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier. Backchannel negotiations between the US and Afghan Islamists had been going on since late last year. And in recent weeks the two sides had hinted at a framework peace deal that entailed the US effecting a partial pullout of troops and vacating three Afghan bases in exchange for Taliban’s promise to sever ties with al-Qaida and not allow Afghan soil to be used for attacks against the US and its allies.However, the talks bore the characteristics of a surrender negotiation. After all, Taliban have refused to cede an inch. They continue to reject any formal talks with the elected Afghan government and made no pretence of scaling back violence during dialogue with the American envoy. Taliban, having fought American-led forces for 18 years, are confident it is only a matter of time before the Americans leave. And Trump since last year has insisted that US military presence in Afghanistan must end.What makes Taliban so strong is Pakistan which provides the militants safe haven on its soil. This factor is also what buoys the Kashmir insurgency and may have prompted New Delhi’s decision to nullify Article 370. As long as this arrangement remains and Islamabad continues to view Afghanistan as providing strategic depth, there’s little chance that Washington will get a peace deal that enables an orderly end to the war. The US needs to crack down on Pakistan’s support for Taliban if it is to acquire a position of strength in Afghan negotiations.533 days ago UNTIL the UNMENTIONED 800Lbs GORILLA in the \"room\"PAKISTAN is not ADDRESSED effectively&the military ISI controle of TALIBAN broken there won't be a SOLUTION to AFGANISTAN.

        "date": "September 9, 2019, 7:59 PM  IST",
        "article": "Isro chief K Sivan has stated its Vikram lunar module, part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, had a hard landing on the lunar surface. Perhaps something similar could be said about the India story, which had risen dramatically over the last decade but no longer attracts so much attention. Investments and savings have soured, the bad loan problem remains, now consumption and demand are collapsing (as unprecedented declines in the bellwether auto sector indicate). GDP growth declined for five successive quarters and hit a low of 5% in the last April-June quarter. As foreign companies ship out of China due to enhanced US tariffs, they are relocating to countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico and Bangladesh while India receives little benefit.While the Modi government has made bold moves on the foreign policy, security and political fronts, economic policy has been marked by excessive caution, incrementalism and empowerment of the bureaucracy rather than markets. This has led to a paradox. As an example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed the international repercussions of the nullification of Article 370 in J&K deftly, while balancing great power relationships with successful meetings with Presidents Macron, Trump and Putin within the last three weeks. But diplomatic heft also comes from economic growth, on which New Delhi is slipping.Alongside Hindutva excesses, widespread lynchings, the NRC fiasco where there is talk about detaining millions in Assam even as the government considers extending NRC to other states, do not cumulatively give rise to a pretty picture. They may constitute the surround sound which explains why the 370 decision, even if inherently justifiable, was in general received negatively in the Western press. India is known as a land of many colours, and any undermining of that reputation will negatively impact its soft power. This amounts to a double whammy, as the economy’s engines failing to fire indicates a decline in hard power as well.In this context, excessive sound and fury in claiming government achievements could come in the way of taking necessary corrective steps and thus prove to be counterproductive. However, by calling for a $5 trillion economy by 2024, Modi proclaimed the right target. And the government can call on enough economic experts who can tell us how to get there. Listen to them, rather than getting bureaucrats to craft economic policy. Have the political courage to take bold reform measures. And yes, social inclusiveness would help too.535 days ago Readers has been reading myriad reporting at lynching topic, but miss the bull eye with wide margin, as ground reality differ what has been coded in Media .

        "date": "August 8, 2019, 8:15 PM  IST",
        "article": "Pakistan has pursued a maximalist strategy against India for so long that it has few arrows left in its quiver, now that it wants to express its ire over India’s nullification of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir. And many of those arrows are counter-productive. It has expelled the Indian high commissioner, but it was only months ago that it was extolling the virtues of formal diplomatic dialogue for peace. Similarly, it has moved to suspend bilateral trade with India. But Pakistan has for long promoted its Kashmir obsession over trade, when the Indian argument has always been that if issues like Kashmir cannot be resolved at the moment, the two countries should normalise trade relations to create a supportive environment for settling Kashmir. As of now, trade ties are too minuscule to matter.Pakistan will also go to the UN over Kashmir – but it has been crying itself hoarse at the UN for a long time and will not cut much ice (unless New Delhi creates a diplomatic fiasco for itself by mishandling expected protests in Kashmir). Pakistan may also consider launching terror attacks on India. However, the world is out of patience with such tactics, and a failure to meet FATF guidelines on terror could choke credit flows. Secondly, it could ignite a war as India is almost certain to retaliate.Instead, it’s time to turn a corner. Pakistan’s leaders should tell its people the truth: that India is as committed to its part of J&K as Pakistan is to the part that it controls; and to live and let live is far better than merely shoring up incessant hostility. Whipping up passions over Kashmir is a legacy issue that can be attributed to previous leaders, whereas for its new-age leadership ‘naya Pakistan’ necessitates turning a fresh page.If war must be conducted against India it can be a war of economic competition, where Pakistan actually stands a far greater chance of winning. After all India’s NDA government, although otherwise popular and firmly entrenched in power, has still not been able to figure out how to make private investments take off. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi once said, let India and Pakistan fight a war to see who can eliminate poverty first. Given India’s strong povertarian-socialist leanings, sensible economic policies combined with ridding the country of jihadis could see Pakistan get there first.567 days ago Pakistan leadership has now officially exposed themselves as terrorist state with statement that Fulwama type of attack in future.

India has not  taken action on POK then reorganising  Kashmir region is completely India's internal matter and constitutional remedy on  the form of appeal in supreme court still exists.

        "date": "August 4, 2019, 7:54 PM  IST",
        "article": "A tense situation descended on Kashmir over the weekend as the annual Amarnath yatra was called off almost two weeks ahead of schedule, with security forces uncovering a terror plot. Arguably, only a BJP government could have pulled off the unprecedented curtailment of the Amarnath yatra – if it had been a non-BJP government, the narrative would have been that it is thwarting a Hindu pilgrimage at the behest of terrorists. Valid questions are being raised about whether the security advisory issued by the J&K government, asking tourists and pilgrims to leave the Valley immediately, was really necessary.Nevertheless, there is a genuine sense within the security establishment that the unprecedented precautions are called for as a major Pakistan-backed terror attack is impending. Seven Pakistani infiltrators have been shot in a bid to enter the Valley. Terrorists from groups like JeM and Hizbul have also been intercepted in separate encounters, and arms recovered from them include devices with Pakistani markings and a US M-24 sniper rifle, suggesting a Pakistani hand. There is heavy firing from across the LoC, to which Indian forces are retaliating.The Amarnath yatra has been attacked by terrorists several times before. If another such attack happens in the present context, after Balakot, and evidence is found of a Pakistani hand, it would amount to a serious provocation and lead to a warlike situation. However, President Donald Trump’s offers to “mediate” on Kashmir may have put the Pakistani establishment in an adventurist mood. It could calculate that any international blowback to terror operations in Kashmir can be countered by threatening to withhold cooperation from US troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. In view of this fraught situation, a case can perhaps be made for extreme security precautions.However, the pulling out of outsiders together with a massive mobilisation of security forces is creating uncertainty and fear in the state. Understandably, it is making people speculate that something big is underway in J&K, and that the Centre is planning to abrogate Article 35A as well as Article 370, which give the state special powers of autonomy. But one reason not to do anything like this now is precisely the fraught situation in the state. The Centre must instead issue a clarification, at a sufficiently senior level to carry credibility, that nothing of this sort is planned.571 days ago Today the serious, blunder mistake of the Former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru will be rectified/corrected, today BJP's Central Government is going to bring a permanent solution to the Kashmir's lingering on the problem, which will leave all Kashmir's Anti-India Leaders speechless.

        "article": "In another push to boost the economy, government has announced new foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for coal mining, contract manufacturing and digital media, while considerably easing rules for single-brand retail. Although in coal mining and contract manufacturing 100% FDI has been allowed via the automatic route, in digital media 26% FDI has been permitted with government approval. In the single-brand retail space, global brands such as Uniqlo, Apple and IKEA now find their sourcing norms eased. While hitherto single-brand retail companies that had more than 51% FDI in India had to source 30% locally of the total value of goods sold in the country, the changed norms will allow them to include exports from the country as well.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-125926\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/economy-300x246.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/economy-300x246.png 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/economy-52x43.png 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/economy.png 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\">This should incentivise businesses like IKEA to expand their operations in India. Meanwhile, government has also allowed single-brand retailers to open online stores before setting up physical stores in the country. This is certain to help foreign players looking to enter the Indian market. It is welcome that government is finally taking note of the downward pressures on the economy. With demand and private investments falling, the new FDI rules send out a positive signal to foreign investors.However, government shouldn’t stop here. It is clear that India’s economic woes today are structural. Therefore, the heavy-lifting of reforming factors of production such as land and labour cannot be put off any longer. BJP has the political mandate to execute this task. It has shown boldness with political decisions like nullification of Article 370.

        "article": "The ramifications of government’s blockbuster Kashmir move will certainly be debated for days to come. But one thing that is clear is that the move changes the terms of engagement with Pakistan. The latter was upping the ante vis-a-vis Kashmir in recent days, confident that it had got the US exactly where it wanted.Washington, keen on withdrawing from Afghanistan and looking to hammer out a peace deal with the Afghan Taliban as early as September, was looking to Islamabad to facilitate the process. This was emboldening Islamabad which had raised the issue of American mediation in Kashmir, a bait that Donald Trump was willing to take.But by nullifying Article 370 that gave special status to Kashmir and creating two new Union territories of J&K and Ladakh, India seized back the momentum and effectively ended the disputed status of Kashmir. This will also change New Delhi’s equation with Islamabad. The latter has always raised Kashmir as a core issue in bilateral engagements. That, New Delhi will point out, is no longer necessary. In fact, India can now fully highlight cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan as the key regional problem.That said, what the latest changes mean for India’s claim on PoK remains to be seen. Technically, India will still claim the areas occupied by Pakistan and China. But having divided Kashmir further and bringing the resultant areas under greater Central control, India’s claims on PoK and Aksai Chin get diluted. But that’s a strategic fight for another day.570 days ago What a dumb thing to say that India's claims on POK and Aksai Chin will now be diluted.

        "date": "September 9, 2019, 12:53 PM  IST",
        "article": "Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s contention that “Hindutva-lite” won’t solve Congress’s Hindi heartland problems reflects the views of an important school of thinking within the party. However, it remains to be seen whether there can be meeting ground between the likes of Tharoor representing Thiruvananthapuram in the far South and Congress’s north Indian leaders. Already, on the issue of Article 370 the support to the government from many Hindi heartland politicians of the Congress reveals how a divergence in party positions is sharpening even along a geographic axis.Before the Lok Sabha elections in which Congress was again blanked out in north India the party had notched wins in three Hindi heartland states and ran BJP close in Gujarat. In Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, Congress leaders visited temples and promised various gau seva measures. It is unclear how much anti-incumbency against BJP and how much soft Hindutva helped Congress do better in those elections.Yet secularism is not a lost cause. Congress can still make a fight of it by correcting old mistakes. For one, it can come out in favour of Uniform Civil Code instead of worrying incessantly about backlash from conservative Muslim clergy. Secondly, it needs to highlight how only a secular India can make progress in the socio-economic domain — a point easier to make with the ongoing economic slump. All is not lost for Congress in the Hindi heartland. The socialist parties that once poached on Congress votes are losing ground faster than the grand old party. However, the younger Congress leaders who consider the north their stomping ground — like Priyanka Gandhi, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and RS Surjewala — will have to work harder to expand both their personal appeal and the Congress organisation.536 days ago No need to revive CHOR and LOOTER congress.

The options before her are limited. Tanwar is Congress’s “young” Dalit face but Hooda is the party’s tallest leader. There are also a number of other factions respectively helmed by Rahul Gandhi lieutenant RS Surjewala,  CLP leader and former CM Bansi Lal’s daughter in law Kiran Choudhary, former Union Minister Kumari Selja, and another former CM Bhajan Lal’s son Kuldeep Bishnoi. If factionalism was bad, far worse for Congress has been the unravelling of its Jat-Dalit base.While Hooda can claim to carry along a significant Jat vote, Haryana’s political dynamics has altered in the past six years. BJP has built a formidable non-Jat social phalanx, wooed many Jat leaders too to its fold like Chaudhary Birender Singh, and perfected the nationalist-Hindutva card. Even if Hooda strikes it out alone, he will find the going hard. The Jat vote also has claimants like INLD and JJP. Meanwhile, BSP has been assiduously wooing the Dalit vote away from Congress. It is possible that Hooda is putting pressure on Sonia like Amarinder Singh in Punjab before the 2017 polls to be made PCC president in place of Rahul loyalist PS Bajwa.

        "article": "Addressing the nation after the nullification of Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to the people of Kashmir and once again reassured them that J&K would regain its statehood after the situation there normalises. He also said that the new Union territory of J&K would soon have elections to its legislature and security restrictions imposed in the region would be eased for upcoming Eid celebrations. This is welcome as the people of J&K certainly needed a message of reassurance from the PM.That said, the road ahead won’t be easy. Nullifying Article 370 was always going to be controversial and large-scale protests can be expected once restrictions are lifted. Dealing with those protesters sensitively would be key to ensuring anti-India forces do not take advantage of local grievances. We haven’t seen sophisticated methods of crowd control deployed in J&K so far; this needs to change. Second, if passions boil over, government must ensure that Kashmiris outside J&K aren’t harmed or inconvenienced in any way by Hindutva or hyper-nationalist goons. Failure on either front would not just frustrate Modi’s effort to reach out to Kashmiris, it would hand Pakistan a propaganda victory as the latter tries its level best to ‘internationalise’ the Kashmir dispute by making the case that Kashmiris are oppressed in India.Finally, government justified its Article 370 move on the ground that it will lead to better development in the region. It should deliver on this promise and ensure visible development in Kashmir. In that sense, the real challenge for government begins now.

        "headline": "Like NRC, the Citizenship Amendment Bill is flawed in conception. Proceed with caution",
        "date": "September 10, 2019, 1:02 PM  IST",
        "article": "Signals emanating from the Union government that it may revive the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) are certain to stir the hornet’s nest in the North-East. The bill itself is a challenge to the Constitution’s secular ethos discriminating against the citizenship claims of Muslim immigrants while opening the doors for other religious communities. After the recent fiasco over the Assam National Register of Citizens, Centre should move carefully and only after consultation with state governments and stakeholders who have problems with the CAB.With fears of being culturally and demographically overwhelmed, the CAB faces opposition in many north-east states. Home minister Amit Shah has stressed that CAB will not undermine the inner-line permits that are necessary to enter some of these states. He also underscored the “permanent” nature of Article 371 which showers special protections on these states while promising that the fate of Article 370 won’t befall it. With a large number of Bengali Hindus being excluded from NRC, the CAB will help BJP firefight the growing outrage against NRC.Also read: NRC has ‘some errors’, rectify them before moving ahead,  RSS tells govt<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-126451\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"379\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead-300x225.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead-768x576.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead-52x39.jpg 52w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NRC-lead.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px\">But the exclusion of only Muslim immigrants from CAB undermines the very rationale for the legislation that refugees must be treated in a humanitarian concern. It is civil war, economic distress, religious persecution, and ethnic and social strife that led many refugees from neighbouring countries to India. Seeing this movement of humanity from a purely religious spectrum may suit political goals but is a body blow to Indian traditions that loudly proclaim “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”. With Bangladesh doing better than India on the economic front, government data itself proclaims that Bangladeshi immigration is only a political bogey. The north-east needs development and connectivity, not CAB or NRC.535 days ago The NRC is a 1.5 Lakh crore sham and waste of money. What happend as a result, BJP is going to make 19 lakh genuine Indians as foreigners (and as per amit goonda sha they are termites) out of which more than 15 lakhs are Hindus. The interesting thing is that BJP was claiming that there are more than 100 lakh illigals in Assam, what a sham. It turned out to be 19 lakh, but after scrutiniy it will reduce to less than 1 lakh...

        "date": "August 20, 2019, 7:48 PM  IST",
        "article": "Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) is on course for its final publication on August 31. This after Supreme Court rejected the Centre’s and Assam government’s plea to re-verify 20% of draft NRC data in the border districts of the state and 10% in other districts. In fact, as much as 27% of the data had already been re-verified earlier. The re-verification demand now is coming from groups who feel that illegal migrants have made it to the NRC and genuine citizens have been left out.This is extremely likely given India’s poor documentation culture. Many of Assam’s residents who are being told to prove their citizenship simply don’t have documents. This doesn’t mean they are all migrants. Add to this the fact that the NRC exercise always had an ethnic dimension to it where Bengali was conflated with Bangladeshi. BJP muddied the waters further by proposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which provided a path to citizenship for Hindus from Bangladesh with December 31, 2014 as the cut-off date. This directly contradicted the Assam Accord which laid down March 24, 1971 as the cut-off for absorbing migrants.Given the north-east’s extremely diverse ethno-religious make-up, a veritable can of worms has been opened. Both the earlier Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and Centre’s recent nullification of Article 370 vis-a-vis Jammu & Kashmir have raised concerns in other north-east states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram which have their own ethnic, nativist issues. Plus, there is no clarity as to the fate of the people excluded from the Assam NRC – 41 lakh have been excluded so far. Coercive measures such as putting them in detention camps will certainly attract charges of gross human rights violation. Given this mess, it would be best not to tinker with NRC further, deal humanely with those excluded from the list, scotch any plans to extend NRC beyond Assam, and focus on strengthening the border with Bangladesh.555 days ago It may be possible that commission of NRC Assam mission would not reach to logical end, however it better than nothing? When nation is at trajectory of growth, rush of migrants may be expected. For this challenge have to formally develop mechanism to apply break at it, as India is already haven of refugees from Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Ceylon, Myanmar and Bangladesh and its own bursting population growth has disproportionate pressure at natural resources which developed crack at ridge, so is no more in condition to accommodate additional refugees from neighbor states or elsewhere? NRC is however if is not commission to the logical result but that is not, that rush of tsunami asylum seekers will be left at mercy to wilderness....

        "article": "The identity of this government is that it neither avoids problems nor lets them fester. So said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort. He was referring to the momentous decision to nullify Article 370. In this view, a temporary provision came to endure for seven decades because earlier governments lacked the courage for course correction. A like charge can be laid at the Modi government’s door, on the economy front.Signs of a worrying slowdown are all around. However, the PM says that every citizen should be dreaming of India becoming a five trillion dollar economy in the next five years, which means that instead of the usual incremental progress it is time to “jump high”. Such exponential progress requires confronting the problems that are holding up the economy.Indeed, the PM called for honouring wealth creators and touched on the need to expand exports, which implies a reversal of the current approach of piling on taxes, tariffs, harassment by tax agencies, high spectrum charges and the like – a ‘maximum government’ approach that ends up hobbling the global competitiveness of the Indian economy. One concrete outcome of the speech was Modi’s announcement of his government’s decision to deliver on the long pending demand for a chief of defence staff for the Indian armed forces – essential for its modernisation and integration and hanging fire since establishing such a post was recommended after the 1999 Kargil war.If the PM’s first term was signatured by the Swachh Bharat campaign, a similar role in the second term may be performed by the Jal Shakti Abhiyan. With many areas suffering drought followed by flooding in recent months it is obvious that India’s water infrastructure and administration need a radical makeover. More efficient use of water is, indeed, a necessary ingredient for India’s economic revitalisation. For such revitalisation, and if India is to hit the $5 trillion target, the government must display decisiveness similar to that which it is willing to exhibit on the security front. It needs to get out of the business of running businesses, including most public sector banks, and to courageously reform the factor markets that have been making India increasingly uncompetitive.559 days ago It is Hindutva and not Economic Future that is focus.U think The RSS/BJPee is going to win elections focusing on the economy? u r wrong.It is Hypernationalism,Pulwama like situation, Ghar mei ghus ke mareingey,Triple Talaq,Article 370,Bharat Mata Ki jai,Jai Sri Ram,Uniform Civil Code etc these the things that will win elections.As long as the Cow belt with illiterate underdeveloped Hindi speaking mobs r there RSS/BJP will rule for another 30 to 50 years,by then INDIA will be ruined....

        "date": "August 6, 2019, 8:22 PM  IST",
        "article": "Kashmir is in lockdown today, but restrictions on everyday activity will need to be removed soon. People in Jammu and Ladakh are likely to welcome the change of Jammu & Kashmir’s status with the Narendra Modi government’s nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution; the same cannot be said of Kashmir. Over the last week the Centre had massively boosted security presence in Kashmir, curtailed the annual Amarnath yatra and even put Kashmiri leaders under house arrest. Clearly, the Centre felt that the security situation could get out of hand with its big Kashmir move.And that threat remains as there could still be big protests in the Kashmir Valley as restrictions there are gradually removed. In fact, there has been a pattern of cyclical violence in Kashmir where large-scale upheavals take place after a period of radicalisation. We saw this in the case of militant Burhan Wani’s death in 2016 which sparked widespread violent protests across Kashmir. Those protests could recur, perhaps on a bigger scale. Supporters of Article 370 would point to its nullification as the reason. Opponents will claim it was going to happen anyway, given that Islamabad feels its time to push a Kashmir jihad is now, following its success in getting the US to wind down in Afghanistan without leaving a stable government in place.But either way, New Delhi will have to find a way of dealing with another round of radicalisation in the Valley. To counter this, the government should sensitively deal with protesters demonstrating against the nullification of special status. One way out could be to offer a path back to statehood for J&K. Union home minister Amit Shah alluded to this in Parliament when he said that J&K can regain its statehood once the situation there normalises.Facilitating development of Kashmir has been cited by government as one of the reasons for nullifying Article 370. Theoretically, now that outsiders can buy property, live and work in Kashmir, this can bring in greater business investment. While its tourism sector could be made world class tax benefits, loosening of regulations, and building of new infrastructure could see modern industries like IT relocate to the region. That’s the Kashmir dream. In real life, the security situation must be stabilised and the government must arrive at a modus vivendi with locals. That looks like being a long haul.569 days ago It is only wishful thinking.

        "article": "In a meeting called by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, India Inc demanded a stimulus package of over Rs 1 lakh crore to kick-start the investment cycle and revive the economy. This is yet another indication that the economy isn’t doing well and comes after poor numbers from the auto industry that marked eight consecutive months of decline. And if falling private investment and consumer demand weren’t enough, there are global headwinds in the form of growing protectionism.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-125082\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/money-300x223.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/money.png 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/money-52x39.png 52w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\">The overall economic sluggishness means that we are creating far fewer jobs than the 10 million required annually. And with automation and AI replacing several manual-input driven processes, whole sets of functions across industries are becoming redundant. The need of the hour, therefore, is deep systemic reforms. True, a stimulus package may lift sentiments and boost spending momentarily. But the country needs to prepare for the oncoming Fourth Industrial Revolution and retrain its workforce accordingly.\nThis is a big challenge given the state of the country’s education and vocational training infrastructure. Nonetheless, we have in power a decisive government that enjoys full majority.Plus, its recent nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution showed that it isn’t afraid to take bold decisions. Thus, it is hoped that government will display equal boldness towards much-needed economic reforms.Besides, an impression is setting in that this government is solely focussed on political issues given their impact on electoral politics. However, if the economy receives a big jolt — for example, due to another conflict in the Middle East that sends the price of crude sky-rocketing — and inflation gets out of hand, then public sentiment is bound to sour. It’s high time government gives political issues a rest and does the requisite heavy lifting on the economic front.Read Also: India Inc demands Rs 1 lakh crore stimulus to revive economy567 days ago No package to Automobile industry.

He suggested that India should be doing more to combat extremism in that country. However, if that means exercising hard power on Afghan soil and filling the vacuum that a potential US withdrawal would cause, there is every reason for New Delhi to exercise caution.India already has a lot on its plate with the situation in Kashmir possibly heating up in the days ahead. Pakistan might try to push in more terrorists to undermine India’s Article 370 decision. Plus, Pakistan has a geographic advantage vis-a-vis Afghanistan and has always blocked India’s access to that landlocked nation. Add to this Islamabad’s leverage with Taliban who are currently engaged in talks with the US for a peace deal. The situation in Afghanistan today is a hornet’s nest, likely to turn even more complicated if the US withdraws. If Indian troops get involved here, our country would be sucked into a vicious proxy war with huge costs.Thus, the Afghan situation doesn’t favour an Indian security intervention. However, India does have legitimate development interests in Afghanistan. And New Delhi must work hard diplomatically to protect these. One option is to work closely with Iran which has considerable influence in Afghanistan. Ideally, India and Pakistan should arrive at a modus vivendi on Afghanistan. After all, Taliban’s revival can boost Pashtun nationalism as well as radical Islamism inside Pakistan, creating a headache for Islamabad.
